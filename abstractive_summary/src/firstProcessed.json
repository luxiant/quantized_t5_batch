[{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the June 22 23 meeting suggested that the economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace in the second quarter.  While the change in total nonfarm payroll employment in May was boosted significantly by the hiring of temporary workers for the decennial census, private employment posted only a small increase.  In April and May, production in high technology industries again rose strongly, with substantial gains in the output of semiconductors and further solid increases in the production of computers and communications equipment.  Revised estimates of labor compensation indicated that hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector was about flat, on net, during the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010.  The outlook in commercial real estate markets stayed weak; prices of commercial properties fell a bit further in the first quarter, and the volume of commercial property sales remained light.  The amount of Treasury and agency securities held by large domestic banks and foreign related institutions declined in May, contributing to a sizable drop in banks securities holdings.  The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight to quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally saw the incoming data and information received from business contacts as consistent with a continued, moderate recovery in economic activity.  Policymakers noted that firms investment in equipment and software had advanced rapidly of late, and they anticipated that such spending would continue to rise, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace.  Although readings from the housing sector had been strong through mid spring, participants noted that the strength likely reflected the effects of the temporary tax credits for homebuyers.","id":108},{"text":" Industrial production registered strong and widespread gains, and business investment in equipment and software rose rapidly.  Falling energy prices held down headline consumer prices in April and May while core consumer prices edged up.  Labor demand continued to firm in recent months.  The rise in consumer spending slowed in recent months after a brisk increase in the first quarter.  Measures of consumer sentiment improved in May and early June but were still at relatively low levels.  Real spending on equipment and software increased further early in the second quarter.  Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a strong pace in the first half of the year.  Secondary market bid prices on syndicated leveraged loans fell, while bid asked spreads in that market widened.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations increased in April and May relative to its pace in the first quarter.  Despite these developments, inflation expectations had remained stable, likely limiting movements in inflation.  Participants also noted ongoing difficulties in financing commercial real estate.  Participants expected the pace of hiring to remain low for some time.  Bank lending has continued to contract in recent months.","id":108},{"text":" Firming domestic demand, rising exports, and business inventory restocking appeared to have provided upward impetus to factory production.  The anticipated expiration of the homebuyer tax credit appeared to have pulled home sales forward, boosting their level in recent months.  Sales of existing single family homes rose strongly in April, and, although they moved down in May, these sales were still above their level earlier in the year.  The core consumer price index rose only slightly over the period, and the year over year change in the index was lower than earlier this year.  Core goods prices continued to decline, on net, and prices of non energy services remained soft.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector, which rose rapidly in 2009, posted a more moderate but still solid gain in the first quarter of 2010.  Consumer credit quality improved further, with delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans moving down a bit in April.  Participants commented that household spending continued to advance, with notable increases in auto sales and expenditures on other durable goods.","id":108},{"text":" The recovery in equipment and software spending was consistent with the relatively strong gains in production in recent months, improved financial conditions over the first part of the year, and the positive readings from surveys on business conditions and earnings reports for producers of capital goods.  In the inaugural Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which was conducted by the Federal Reserve between May 24 and June 4, dealers generally reported that the terms on which they provided credit remained tight relative to those at the end of 2006.  Broad United States stock price indexes fell over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting deepening concerns about the European fiscal situation and its potential for adverse spillovers to global economic growth.  In response, the ECB announced some changes to its liquidity operations that would provide greater market access to term funding in euros.3 Difficulties also appeared in corporate debt markets as both nonfinancial and financial corporate debt issuance dropped substantially in May.  The intensifying concerns among investors about the implications of the fiscal difficulties faced by some European countries contributed to an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and a drop in equity prices, which seemed likely to damp somewhat the expansion of domestic demand.  Moreover, several participants observed that the decline in yields on Treasury securities resulting from the global flight to quality was positive for the domestic economy; in particular, the associated decline in mortgage rates was seen as potentially helpful in supporting the housing sector.  Participants also noted that several uncertainties, including those related to legislative changes and to developments in global financial markets, were generating a heightened level of caution that could lead some firms to delay hiring and planned investment outlays.","id":108},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the April 27 28 meeting suggested that, on balance, the economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace and that the deterioration in the labor market was likely coming to an end.  Fiscal strains in Greece intensified during the intermeeting period, and in mid April, euro area member states announced a plan to provide financing aid to Greece in coordination with the International Monetary Fund.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC at the March meeting to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the extended period language in the statement was largely anticipated by market participants.  However, some market participants reportedly interpreted the retention of the extended period language as pointing to a longer period of low rates than previously expected, and Eurodollar futures rates temporarily declined a bit in response.  The monetary base contracted as the effect on reserves of purchases under the Federal Reserve s large scale asset purchase programs was more than offset by a further contraction in credit outstanding under liquidity and credit facilities and an increase in the Treasury s balances at the Federal Reserve.  Some participants saw the possibility of elevated foreclosures adding to the already very large inventory of vacant homes as posing a downside risk to home prices, thereby limiting the extent of the pickup in residential investment for a while.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 15 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is beginning to improve.","id":109},{"text":" If other European countries responded by intensifying their fiscal consolidation efforts, the result would likely be slower growth in Europe and potentially a weaker global economic recovery.  However, a number of participants pointed out that the recent moderation in price changes was widespread across many categories of spending and was evident in measures that exclude the most extreme price movements in each period.  Committee Policy Action In the members discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, they agreed that no changes to the Committee s federal funds rate target range were warranted at this meeting.","id":109},{"text":" The average workweek also rose last quarter and data from the household survey pointed to a firming in labor market conditions.  Capacity utilization stood significantly above the trough recorded last June but was still well below its long run average.  Home sales strengthened noticeably, as sales of new single family homes jumped and sales of existing single family homes rose as well.  On balance over the intermeeting period, the expected path of policy edged down slightly.  Overall, conditions in short term funding markets remained generally stable during the intermeeting period.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was positive in March.  The decline in outstanding commercial mortgage debt in the fourth quarter of last year was the largest on record.  Many participants noted that employment had increased in recent months, and that they expected a further firming of labor market conditions going forward.  Moreover, the recovery in the housing market appeared to have stalled in recent months despite various forms of government support.  Business investment was expected to be supported by improved conditions in financial markets.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.","id":109},{"text":" Despite the strength of exports, merchandise trade balances declined for some countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports.  Foreign inflation was boosted by increases in the prices of oil and other commodities, but core inflation generally remained subdued.  However, many participants noted that while financial markets had improved, bank lending was still contracting and credit remained tight for many borrowers.  Based on this outlook, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range of 0 to percent for the federal funds rate.  With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.","id":109},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the March 16 meeting suggested that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in early 2010. Business investment in equipment and software seemed to have picked up, consumer spending increased further in January, and private employment would likely have turned up in February in the absence of the snowstorms that affected the East Coast.  After increasing briskly in the second half of 2009, industrial production (IP) continued to expand, on net, in the early months of 2010, rising sharply in January and remaining little changed in February despite some adverse effects of the snowstorms.  Some of the recent weakness in sales might have been due to transactions that had been pulled forward in anticipation of the originally scheduled expiration of the tax credit for first time homebuyers in November 2009; nonetheless, the underlying pace of housing demand likely remained weak.  Despite low and stable spreads on consumer asset backed securities (ABS), the amount of ABS issued in the first two months of the year was somewhat below that in the fourth quarter, reflecting the very weak pace of consumer credit originations late last year.  While participants saw incoming information as broadly consistent with continued strengthening of economic activity, they also highlighted a variety of factors that would be likely to restrain the overall pace of recovery, especially in light of the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and inventory rebalancing over coming quarters.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt; those purchases are nearing completion, and the remaining transactions will be executed by the end of this month.","id":110},{"text":" Household income appeared less supportive of spending than at the January meeting, reflecting downward revisions to estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of wages and salaries in the second half of 2009.  Sales of both new and existing homes had turned down, while starts of single family homes were about unchanged despite the substantial reduction in inventories of unsold new homes.  That divergence appeared to have persisted in the first quarter, as indicators pointed to continued rapid economic growth in Canada and moderate expansion in Japan but somewhat anemic growth in Europe.  Spreads of rates on A2/P2 rated commercial paper and on AA rated asset backed commercial paper over the AA nonfinancial rate were also little changed at low levels.  The Federal Reserve continued to taper its large scale asset purchases and wind down the emergency lending facilities with no apparent adverse effects on financial markets or institutions.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was about zero over the first two months of 2010, consistent with firms weak demand for credit and banks tight credit policies.  Although increased oil prices had boosted overall inflation over recent months, the staff anticipated that consumer prices for energy would increase more slowly going forward, consistent with quotes on oil futures contracts.  However, a few participants noted the possibility that fiscal retrenchment in some foreign countries could trigger a slowdown of those economies and hence weigh on the demand for United States exports.  Participants were also concerned that activity in the housing sector appeared to be leveling off in most regions despite various forms of government support, and they noted that commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to weaken.  While the ongoing decline in the implicit rental cost for owner occupied housing was weighing on core inflation, a number of participants observed that the moderation in price changes was widespread across many categories of spending.  This moderation was evident in the appreciable slowing of inflation measures such as trimmed means and medians, which exclude the most extreme price movements in each period.  A number of members noted that the Committee s expectation for policy was explicitly contingent on the evolution of the economy rather than on the passage of any fixed amount of calendar time.  Members noted the importance of continued close monitoring of financial markets and institutions including asset prices, levels of leverage, and underwriting standards to help identify significant financial imbalances at an early stage.","id":110},{"text":" Activity in the housing sector appeared to have flattened out in recent months.  The recent gains in investment spending were consistent with improvements in many indicators of business demand.  In contrast, conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remained poor.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Consumer loans originated by banks declined, primarily reflecting a large drop in credit card loans.  Participants agreed that financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.","id":110},{"text":" Commercial and industrial (C I) loans continued falling, as spreads of interest rates on C I loans over comparable maturity market instruments climbed further in the first quarter and nonfinancial firms need for external finance apparently remained subdued.  Indeed, housing sales and starts had flattened out at depressed levels, suggesting that previous improvements in those indicators may have largely reflected transitory effects from the first time homebuyer tax credit rather than a fundamental strengthening of housing activity.  In light of the improved functioning of financial markets, Committee members agreed that it would be appropriate for the statement to be released following the meeting to indicate that the previously announced schedule for closing the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility was being maintained.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 15 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is stabilizing.","id":110},{"text":" 3.  4.  3.  4.  3.  4.  3.","id":111},{"text":" The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.

With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury; B.  Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the United States dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.  Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Committee met on December 15 16, 2009.  Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth, though volatility in securities markets increased notably toward the end of the intermeeting period.  The Manager also reported on System open market operations in agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period.  The Desk continued to gradually slow the pace of its purchases of these securities as it moved toward completing the Committee s program of asset purchases by March 31.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Staff briefed the Committee on current usage of the discount window and other liquidity facilities and suggested additional steps policymakers could take to normalize the Federal Reserve s liquidity provision.  Setting the spread reflects a balance between two objectives encouraging depository institutions to use the discount window as a backup source of liquidity when they are faced with temporary liquidity shortfalls or when funding markets are disrupted, and discouraging depository institutions from relying on the discount window as a routine source of funds when other funding is generally available.  The spread was 100 basis points before the financial crisis emerged; the Federal Reserve narrowed the spread to 50 basis points and then to 25 basis points as part of its response to the financial crisis.  Participants judged that improvements in bank funding markets warranted reducing amounts offered at TAF auctions toward zero in three steps over the next few months, while noting that they would be prepared to modify that plan if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.  They agreed that it would soon be appropriate to return the maturity of primary credit loans to overnight and to widen the spread between the primary credit rate and the top of the Committee s target range for the federal funds rate.  Staff also briefed policymakers about tools and strategies for an eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation and summarized linkages between these tools and strategies and alternative frameworks for implementing monetary policy in the longer run.  All but the first of these tools would shrink the supply of reserve balances; the last two would also shrink the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  All agreed that raising the IOER rate and the target for the federal funds rate would be a key element of a move to less accommodative monetary policy.  With respect to longer run approaches to implementing monetary policy, most policymakers saw benefits in continuing to use the federal funds rate as the operating target for implementing monetary policy, so long as other money market rates remained closely linked to the federal funds rate.  Many thought that an approach in which the primary credit rate was set above the Committee s target for the federal funds rate and the IOER rate was set below that target a corridor system would be beneficial.  Several saw advantages to using the IOER rate, rather than a target for a market rate, to indicate the stance of policy.  Finally, staff noted that the Committee might want to address both the eventual size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet and its composition.  Policymakers were unanimous in the view that it will be appropriate to shrink the supply of reserve balances and the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet substantially over time.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 26 27 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months.  Recent data suggested that the pace of inventory liquidation diminished considerably last quarter, providing a sizable boost to economic activity.  The pace of job losses continued to moderate The three month change in private nonfarm payrolls had become progressively less negative since early 2009; that pattern was widespread across industries.  The gain in December primarily resulted from a jump in output at electric and natural gas utilities caused by unseasonably cold weather.  Output of consumer goods, business equipment, and materials all rose in the fourth quarter, though the average monthly gains in these categories were a little smaller than in the third quarter.  Retail sales may have been held down by unusually bad weather, but purchases of new light motor vehicles continued to increase.  The fundamental determinants of household spending including real disposable income and wealth strengthened modestly, on balance, near the end of the year but were still relatively weak.  The recovery in the housing market slowed in the second half of 2009, even though a number of factors supported housing demand.  Sales of existing single family homes rose strongly from July to November but fell in December, a pattern that suggested sales were pulled ahead in anticipation of the originally scheduled expiration of the first time homebuyer credit on November 30.  The pace of construction was slow enough that even the modest pace of new home sales was sufficient to further reduce the overhang of unsold new single family houses.  Real spending on equipment and software apparently rose robustly in the fourth quarter following a slight increase in the previous quarter.  Real spending on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector dropped in the third quarter; data on nominal expenditures through November pointed to an even faster rate of decline in the fourth quarter.  Financial market conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, and short term funding markets were generally stable.  Use of Federal Reserve credit facilities edged lower over the intermeeting period, and market commentary suggested little concern about the impending expiration of a number of the facilities.  After trending higher for most of the intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes subsequently reversed course amid elevated volatility, ending the period little changed on balance.  Estimates of bid asked spreads for corporate bonds a measure of liquidity in the corporate bond market remained steady.  In the leveraged loan market, average bid prices rose further and bid asked spreads were little changed.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses was near zero in the fourth quarter after declining in the third, consistent with weak demand for credit and still tight credit standards and terms at banks.  In December, gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms maintained its solid pace and issuance by financial firms increased noticeably, as several large banks issued shares and used the proceeds to repay capital injections they had received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  Moody s index of commercial property prices showed another drop in October, bringing the index back to its 2002 level.  The average interest rate on 30 year conforming fixed rate residential mortgages increased slightly over the intermeeting period but remained within the narrow range of values over recent months.  Issuance of credit card asset backed securities was minimal in October and November but picked up in December after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced a temporary extension of safe harbor rules for its handling of securitized assets should a sponsoring bank be taken into receivership.  Although a substantial fraction of banks continued to tighten their credit policies on commercial real estate loans in the fourth quarter, lending standards for most other types of loans were little changed, according to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.  The monetary base and total bank reserves were roughly flat, as the contraction in credit outstanding from the Federal Reserve s liquidity and credit facilities was about offset by the Desk s purchases of agency debt and MBS.  European financial stocks declined substantially, as early profit reports for the fourth quarter from a few banks rekindled some concerns about the health of the banking system.  The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose, reportedly reflecting a growing perception that United States growth prospects were better than those in Europe and Japan.  Concerns that policy tightening by China might restrain the global recovery also may have contributed to the dollar s appreciation against many currencies late in the period.  Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff revised up its estimate of the increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Nonfarm businesses apparently moved earlier to stem the pace of inventory liquidation than the staff had anticipated.  Apart from the fluctuations in inventories, economic developments largely were as the staff had anticipated.  The staff also continued to expect that resource slack would be taken up only gradually over the forecast period.  Longer run projections represent each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.  Many noted the evidence that the pace of inventory decumulation slowed quite substantially in the fourth quarter of 2009 as firms increased output to bring production into closer alignment with sales.  Participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions.  But if the unusually rapid productivity growth seen in recent quarters was not sustained, then job growth could pick up significantly as productivity returned to sustainable levels.  The rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months appeared to be continuing; historical experience suggested that increased use of temporary help could presage a broader increase in job growth.  Participants generally saw the data and anecdotal evidence as indicating moderate growth in demands for goods and services, although with substantial variation across sectors.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that such spending was being driven by opportunities to reduce costs and by replacement investment that firms had deferred during the downturn.  By and large, participants judged that residential investment had stabilized but did not expect housing construction to make a sizable contribution to economic growth during the next year or two.  Policymakers judged that financial conditions were, on balance, about as supportive of growth as when the Committee met in December.  Though volatility in equity prices increased late in the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes were about unchanged overall, private credit spreads narrowed somewhat, and financial markets generally continued to function significantly better than early last year.  Survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable, but some market based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested continuing concern among market participants about the risk of higher medium term inflation, perhaps reflecting large fiscal deficits and the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  The Committee emphasized that it would continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  Members recognized that references to purchases of securities would need to be modified as the completion of the asset purchase programs draws near.  Other members judged that it would be premature to make such a change in the statement before observing economic and financial conditions as the Committee s current asset purchase program comes to a close.  Members agreed that the path of short term rates going forward would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.  In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced.","id":111},{"text":" For instance, real outlays on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector plunged in the third quarter.  In contrast, yields on nominal 10 year Treasury securities edged higher on balance.  Moreover, with support from the TALF, the first CMBS issue in nearly 18 months came to market.  In contrast, gross issuance of investment and speculative grade bonds was robust in November.  Participants noted, however, that securitization markets were still substantially impaired.  All agreed that the path of short term rates going forward would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.  The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.","id":112},{"text":" The runoff in commercial real estate loans continued, consistent with the further weakening of fundamentals in that sector.  In contrast, the European Central Bank took some initial steps toward scaling back emergency lending.  Consumer spending appeared to be on a moderately rising trend, reflecting gains in after tax income and wealth this year.","id":112},{"text":" Sales of new homes increased significantly in recent months, a development that, given the slow pace of construction, reduced the inventory of unsold new homes; sales of existing homes rose strongly.  Spending on equipment and software continued to stabilize, but investment in nonresidential structures declined further as conditions in nonresidential real estate markets remained poor.  The length of the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers increased in November; moreover, aggregate hours worked registered the first substantial increase since the recession began.  The latest readings from indexes of consumer sentiment remained within the relatively low range that prevailed over the previous six months, apparently still weighed down by weak labor market conditions and prior declines in household net worth.  The recent increases in sales likely reflected improved fundamentals The average interest rate on 30 year conforming fixed rate mortgages declined to less than 5 percent, and surveys suggested that households now expected home prices to be fairly stable over the next year.  Although some house price indexes declined a little in September and October, they remained above the troughs reached last spring.  Most other categories of imports, including automotive goods, industrial supplies other than oil and gold, consumer goods, and capital goods, posted solid increases in the past two months.  Revised data showed solid increases in hourly compensation in the second and third quarters, along with quite rapid productivity growth and a further decline in unit labor costs.  However, market participants took note of the Committee s explicit enumeration of the factors that were expected to continue to warrant this policy stance, and Eurodollar futures rates fell a bit on the release.  Yields on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds fell a little more than those on comparable maturity nominal Treasury securities, leaving their spreads somewhat narrower.  The Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in November indicated that the average C I loan rate spread over comparable maturity market instruments rose for the fifth consecutive survey.  Stock price indexes in major emerging markets increased as well, particularly in Brazil and Mexico, amid generally rising commodity prices and a better than expected Mexican GDP report; Chinese stock prices also increased strongly.  On balance, the dollar ended the period up slightly against the major foreign currencies and down a little relative to the currencies of other important trading partners.  Subsequently, the sovereign debt rating for Greece was lowered amid long standing concerns over its public finances and a widening of its sovereign CDS spreads.  It announced that the one year refinancing operation in December would be its last and that the cost of the funds provided would float with interest rates set in future refinancing operations rather than being fixed as in previous such operations.  Better than expected data on employment, consumer spending, home sales, and industrial production received during the intermeeting period pointed to a somewhat stronger increase in real GDP in the current quarter than had previously been projected.  Participants expected the economic recovery to continue, but, consistent with experience following previous financial crises, most anticipated that the pickup in output and employment growth would be rather slow relative to past recoveries from deep recessions.  Recent upward revisions to official estimates of the level of household income in recent quarters gave participants somewhat greater confidence that consumer spending would continue to expand.  The housing sector showed continuing signs of improvement, though housing starts had leveled out after increasing earlier in the year and activity remained quite low.  Financial market conditions were generally regarded as having become more supportive of continued economic recovery during the intermeeting period Equity prices rose further, private credit spreads narrowed somewhat, and financial markets generally continued to function significantly better than early in the year.  Although the November employment report was considerably better than anticipated, several participants observed that more than one good report would be needed to provide convincing evidence of recovery in the labor market.  The combination of rising consumer spending, slower destocking, and rising goods production was reflected in reports from major transportation companies that shipping volumes were up.  In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had risen relative to the very low levels reported in the spring; moreover, house prices appeared to be stabilizing and in some areas had reportedly moved higher.  Most participants anticipated that substantial slack in labor and product markets, along with well anchored inflation expectations, would keep inflation subdued in the near term, although they had differing views as to the relative importance of those two factors.  Moreover, a few participants noted that banks might seek, as the economy improves, to reduce their excess reserves quickly and substantially by purchasing securities or by easing credit standards and expanding their lending.  In the Committee s discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all members agreed that no changes to the Committee s large scale asset purchase programs, or to its target range for the federal funds rate, were warranted at this meeting, inasmuch as the economic outlook had changed little since the November meeting.  In that context, several members noted that the TALF was still providing important support for securitization markets, particularly the CMBS market, and that improvements in the functioning of securitization markets were lagging behind those in other financial markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  These facilities include the Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility.","id":112},{"text":" Business surveys suggested that factory output would advance further in the coming months.

With significant underutilization of resources expected to persist for several years, the staff continued to project that core inflation would slow somewhat further over the next two years.  Members also decided to reiterate their intention to gradually slow the pace of the Committee s agency MBS and agency debt purchases to promote a smooth transition in markets as the announced purchases are completed.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","id":113},{"text":" The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan continued implementing their special liquidity and asset purchase programs, although Bank of Japan officials indicated they would let some credit easing programs expire at the end of the year.  Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the November FOMC meeting, the staff raised its projection for real GDP growth over the second half of 2009 but left the forecast for output growth in 2010 and 2011 roughly unchanged.  The staff anticipated that the strengthening of the recovery in real output during 2010 and 2011 would be supported by an ongoing improvement in financial conditions and household balance sheets, continued recovery in the housing sector, improved household and business confidence, and accommodative monetary policy even as the impetus to real activity from fiscal policy diminished.  In the meeting participants discussion of the economic situation and outlook, they agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts suggested that economic activity was picking up as anticipated, with output continuing to expand in the fourth quarter.  Indeed, participants expected that businesses would be able to meet any increases in demand in the near term by raising their employees hours and boosting productivity, thus delaying the need to add to their payrolls; this view was supported by aggregate data indicating rapid productivity growth in recent quarters.  Uncertain job prospects, slow income growth, and tight credit, as well as wealth levels that remained relatively low despite the recent rise in equity prices and stabilization in house prices, were seen as weighing on consumer confidence and the growth of consumer spending for some time to come.  Based on this outlook, members decided to maintain the federal funds target range at 0 to 1/4 percent and to continue to state their expectation that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates for an extended period.  Low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations were among the important factors underlying their expectation for monetary policy, and members agreed that policy communications would be enhanced by citing these conditions in the policy statement.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.","id":113},{"text":" With respect to the large scale asset purchase programs, all members supported reiterating the Committee s intention to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.","id":113},{"text":" The pace of decline in total loans at large banks continued to exceed that at smaller banks.  The staff forecast for inflation was little changed from the September meeting.","id":113},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the November 3 4 meeting suggested that overall economic activity continued to rise in recent months.  Although single family starts were about flat in September, the number of starts was well above the record low reached in the first quarter of the year.  Although some house price indexes had risen in recent months, such indexes remained below year earlier levels.  The recent trend in architectural billings was consistent with further declines in nonresidential construction, and employment in the sector continued to decline.  The PCE price index moved up only a bit in September as increases in energy prices were largely offset by declines in food prices.  The trade weighted index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed over the intermeeting period.  The CRE sector was also considered a downside risk to the forecast and a possible source of increased pressure on banks.  In contrast, smaller firms, which tend to be more dependent on commercial banks for financing, reportedly faced substantial constraints in their access to credit.  Although consumer spending had picked up more than expected in recent months, participants saw that increase as partly reflecting special factors such as the cash for clunkers program.","id":113},{"text":" Although consumer spending on motor vehicles declined in September after the expiration of government rebates, other household spending rose.  The monthly pattern in expenditures was significantly affected by swings in motor vehicle sales during and after the government s cash for clunkers program.  Bank share prices fell, with equity prices for large banks declining more than those for regional and smaller banks.  Indeed, participants noted that business contacts continued to report plans to be cautious in hiring and capital spending even as demand for their products increased.","id":113},{"text":" Meanwhile, consumer price inflation remained subdued in recent months.  The inventory of unsold new homes declined further, as sales outpaced construction.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities were about unchanged on net.  Overall conditions in short term funding markets eased a bit further during the intermeeting period.  While liquid deposits rose rapidly, small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds continued to contract.  Meanwhile, currency increased amid moderate demand for United States currency from abroad.  On balance, the economic outlook had changed little since the September meeting.  The recovery appeared to be continuing and was expected to gradually strengthen over time.","id":113},{"text":" Broad stock price indexes were about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period despite initial third quarter earnings reports that mostly beat analysts forecasts.  Nonetheless, participants expected the recovery to continue in subsequent quarters, although at a pace that would be rather slow relative to historical experience, particularly the robust recoveries that followed previous steep downturns.  Nonetheless, economic growth was expected to strengthen during the next two years as housing construction continued to rise and financial conditions improved further, leading to more substantial increases in resource utilization in product and labor markets.","id":113},{"text":" Credit from banks remained difficult to obtain and costly for many borrowers; these conditions were expected to improve only gradually.  A few continued to see some risk of substantial further disinflation, but that risk had eased somewhat further over the intermeeting period.  Recent data on new orders and shipments pointed to an earlier bottoming out in equipment and investment spending than previously anticipated.","id":114},{"text":" Although employment losses continued to be widespread, the rate of decline diminished in most industries.  This program contributed to a further surge in motor vehicle sales in August to their highest level since the first half of 2008.  The sales data for July indicated further increases in the demand for both new and existing single family homes.  Imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and industrial supplies also rose markedly.  Bid asked spreads held roughly steady, and trading volumes remained low.  Changes in investor sentiment toward claims on financial firms were mixed over the intermeeting period.  Equity prices for larger banks increased, but stock prices for regional and smaller banks were little changed.  Global financial markets showed some further signs of stabilization over the intermeeting period.  Despite these positive factors, many participants noted that the economic recovery was likely to be quite restrained.  The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near completion.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased.","id":114},{"text":" Consumer spending on motor vehicles during that period was boosted by government rebates and greater dealer incentives, and household spending outside of motor vehicles appeared to rise in August after having been roughly flat from May through July.  In contrast, in the much smaller multifamily sector, where credit conditions were still particularly tight and vacancy rates remained high, starts continued to be down, on net, in 2009 after a significant fall in the second half of 2008.  Through the end of the second quarter, many house price indexes had smaller year over year declines than they had shown earlier this year, and some indexes recorded positive changes for the second quarter.  Nonetheless, most participants anticipated that slack in both labor and product markets would be substantial over the next few years, leading to subdued and potentially declining wage and price inflation.  The Committee agreed that it would continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  Members discussed the importance of maintaining flexibility to expand the asset purchase programs should the economic outlook deteriorate or to scale back the programs should economic and financial conditions improve more than anticipated.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":114},{"text":" Nevertheless, the factory utilization rate in August was only modestly above its recent historical low.  Real spending on E S appeared to be stabilizing after falling sharply for more than a year.  Many participants noted that since August, they had revised up their projections for the second half of 2009 and for subsequent years.  In that environment, households saving behavior remained an important source of uncertainty in the outlook.","id":114},{"text":" Firms continued to reduce payrolls, but job losses abated further in August, with the decline in private payroll employment the smallest since that of August 2008.  Sales of existing homes in July were at their fastest pace since mid 2007, and pending home sales agreements suggested that resale activity would rise further in following months.  Conditions in the secondary market for leveraged syndicated loans continued to improve slowly, as secondary market prices rose slightly and bid asked spreads narrowed.  However, commercial paper outstanding was unchanged and bank loans fell again; as a result, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector declined, on net, again in August.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.","id":114},{"text":" In particular, the weak labor market continued to restrain growth in household income, and the prior declines in household net worth probably continued to weigh on spending.  At the same time, the latest Survey of Terms of Business Lending showed that C I loan spreads over comparable maturity market instruments rose noticeably in recent months.  The reduced demand for M2 assets likely reflected low interest rates on retail deposits and money market mutual fund shares, as well as a continued reallocation of wealth toward riskier assets.  Subsequently, as the housing market picked up further and financial conditions improved, economic growth was expected to strengthen, leading to more substantial increases in resource utilization over time.  Firms appeared to be reducing inventories and fixed investment at a slower pace than earlier in the year and had made substantial progress in reducing stocks toward desired levels.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.","id":114},{"text":" With labor markets still weak, the year over year increase in average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers slowed further in August, even with the higher federal minimum wage that went into effect at the end of July.  As a result of the expected increase in final sales and an anticipated reduction in inventory liquidation, the staff projected that real GDP would increase in the second half of 2009 at a rate somewhat above the growth rate of potential output.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the incoming data and information received from business contacts suggested that economic activity had picked up following its severe downturn; most thought an economic recovery was under way.","id":114},{"text":" Overall imports of consumer goods were also about unchanged, as a large decline in pharmaceuticals offset increases in a number of other goods.  Consistent with reduced concerns about the financial condition of large banking institutions, London interbank offered rates (Libor) continued to edge down.","id":115},{"text":" However, with labor markets still quite slack, year over year growth in average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers slowed further in July.  Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.  All told, the staff continued to project that real GDP would start to increase in the second half of 2009 and that output growth would pick up to a pace somewhat above its potential rate in 2010.  The projected increase in production in the second half of 2009 was expected to be the result of a slowing in the pace of inventory liquidation; final sales were not projected to increase until 2010.  Regional surveys and anecdotal reports continued to indicate low levels of activity across many goods producing industries and in the service sector, but they also pointed to some optimism about the outlook.  The Desk is expected to purchase about $300 billion of longer term Treasury securities by the end of October, gradually slowing the pace of these purchases until they are completed.","id":115},{"text":" The improvement in financial markets was due, in part, to support from various government programs, and market functioning might deteriorate as those programs wind down.  Consumer spending remained weak, but participants saw evidence that it was stabilizing, even before the boost to auto purchases provided by the cash for clunkers program.  In contrast, business contacts generally reported setting a high bar for increasing capital investment once sales pick up, because their firms now have unusually high levels of excess capacity.","id":115},{"text":" Payrolls in nonbusiness services posted their third monthly gain, supported by the continued uptrend in health and education and a small gain in the leisure and hospitality industry.  Business outlays on motor vehicles leveled off in the second quarter after an extended period of steep declines.  Imports of services and automotive products moved down somewhat, while non oil industrial supplies were largely unchanged.  By themselves, the revised income estimates would imply a lower forecast of consumer spending in coming quarters.","id":115},{"text":" Employment declines in business and financial services in July were also smaller than those in recent months.  However, job losses in the construction industry continued at about the recent rate.  Bid asked spreads held roughly steady, and trading volumes remained low.  Currency expanded weakly, apparently because of soft foreign demand.  Benchmark gilt yields fell noticeably on the announcement after moving higher in July.  Markets for corporate debt continued to improve, and private credit spreads narrowed further.  Labor market conditions remained of particular concern to meeting participants.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks.","id":115},{"text":" The moderation in the pace of decline in industrial production in the second quarter was widespread across industries and major market groups.  Real spending in the high tech sector declined, although real outlays for computing equipment posted their first gain in a year.  Several participants noted that the deceleration in labor costs should eventually support a pickup in hiring.","id":115},{"text":" Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at the June meeting to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and to maintain the sizes of its large scale asset purchase programs, along with the accompanying statement, were broadly in line with market expectations.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the incoming data and anecdotal evidence had strengthened their confidence that the downturn in economic activity was ending and that growth was likely to resume in the second half of the year.  Participants again observed that obtaining or renewing financing for commercial real estate properties and projects was extremely difficult amid worsening fundamentals in that sector, though some noted anecdotal evidence that the addition of highly rated commercial MBS to the list of securities that can be pledged as collateral for TALF loans had contributed to an improvement in liquidity in that market.  The unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek, combined with indications from business contacts that firms would resist hiring as sales and production turn up, also pointed to a period of modest job gains and thus a slow decline in the unemployment rate.","id":115},{"text":" The decline in output in the advanced foreign economies deepened in the first quarter.  Consumer spending appeared no longer to be declining but nonetheless remained weak.","id":116},{"text":" Rates for conforming 30 year fixed rate mortgages rose on net between late April and late June but remained below the levels seen over most of 2008.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.","id":116},{"text":" The value of oil imports also rose, as higher prices outweighed lower volumes.  Nonetheless, most participants saw the economy as still quite weak and vulnerable to further adverse shocks.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing related agency debt by the end of this year.","id":116},{"text":" In addition, average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls, which had dropped substantially from September to March, were essentially unchanged in April and May.  Yields on speculative grade and investment grade corporate bonds dropped, and spreads over yields on comparable maturity Treasury securities narrowed considerably.  The Committee anticipates that the combination of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.","id":116},{"text":" Despite the high level of joblessness, the labor force participation rate moved up for a second consecutive month to a level close to where it was at the beginning of the recession.  However, in the days following the release of the May employment report, which was read as being significantly less negative than anticipated, market participants marked up their expected path for the federal funds rate.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants generally agreed that the information received since the April meeting indicated that the economic contraction was slowing and that the decline in activity could cease before long.  The continued sluggishness in consumer expenditures mainly reflected falling employment, sharply lower wealth as a result of earlier steep declines in asset prices, and tight credit conditions.","id":116},{"text":" Purchasing managers indexes rebounded from the exceptionally low levels reached in the first quarter, and industrial production stabilized somewhat.  The projected boost to aggregate demand from these factors more than offset the negative effects of higher oil prices and mortgage rates.  Nonetheless, the low level of resource utilization was projected to result in an appreciable deceleration in core consumer prices through 2010.  Still, participants generally noted that the improvement in market conditions was in part due to ongoing support from various government programs and that underlying financial conditions remained fragile.  Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.","id":116},{"text":" Because these factors were not seen as likely to dissipate quickly, most participants judged that consumer spending would continue to be subdued for some time.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.","id":116},{"text":" Although the months supply of nonfarm business inventories remained elevated, large production cutbacks in recent quarters allowed producers to stem the rise in stocks relative to sales.  Most major categories of exports fell, with exports of machinery, industrial supplies, and consumer goods exhibiting significant declines.  The value of imports of goods and services also edged down after remaining about unchanged in March.  Most stock markets in emerging market economies rose considerably, and mutual fund flows into those markets strengthened.  These factors, along with past declines in wealth, would weigh on consumer spending.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn.","id":116},{"text":" Existing home sales in March were slightly below the average pace for January and February.  Conditions in short term funding markets improved somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Still, daily trading volumes for Treasury securities remained low.  Even so, corporate bond spreads remained extremely high by historical standards.  No issuance of commercial MBS occurred over the intermeeting period.","id":117},{"text":" The available data suggested that real consumer spending rose moderately in the first quarter after having fallen in the second half of last year.  Real outlays on new and used motor vehicles expanded in the first quarter following six consecutive quarterly declines.  In contrast, the producer price index for core intermediate materials fell, though at a noticeably slower pace than in late 2008.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.","id":117},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the April 28 29 meeting indicated that the pace of decline in some components of final demand appeared to have slowed recently.  The output of high technology products decreased in March and in the first quarter overall, with production of computers and semiconductors extending the downward trend that had begun in the second half of 2008.  As measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, consumer sentiment strengthened a bit in early April, as households expressed somewhat more optimism about long term economic conditions; however, even with this improvement, the measure was only slightly above the historical low for the series recorded last November.  The contraction in the multifamily sector also showed signs of slowing, as the drop in starts in the first quarter was well below the pace experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Sales of new single family homes held steady in March after edging up in February, but the level of such sales remained low, leaving the supply of new homes relative to the pace of sales very high by historical standards.  In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, the net percentages of respondents that reported they tightened their business lending policies over the previous three months, although continuing to be very elevated, edged down for the second consecutive survey.  The fall in oil imports was driven by lower volumes as prices moved up slightly; prices of non oil imports moved down, but falling volumes accounted for most of the decline in this category.  In the United States, overall consumer prices increased over the first three months of 2009 after falling in the fourth quarter of 2008 Energy prices rebounded somewhat after their substantial late year drop, and core prices picked up.  In addition, market participants reportedly interpreted the statement that the federal funds rate was likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period as stronger than the phrase for some time in the previous statement.  Functioning in the repurchase agreement (repo) market showed additional improvement, as bid asked spreads and haircuts on most collateral either narrowed or held steady, although repo volumes were still low.  Broad stock price indexes rose significantly, reportedly buoyed by announcements of policy measures to enhance credit markets and clean up banks balance sheets and perhaps by some reduction in concerns about the economic outlook.  The spread between the forward trend earnings price ratio for S P 500 firms and an estimate of the real long run Treasury yield a rough gauge of the equity risk premium narrowed during the intermeeting period but was still very high by historical standards.  The basis between an index of credit default swap spreads and measures of investment grade corporate spreads a rough proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the corporate credit market stayed at high levels, reportedly reflecting an ongoing lack of financing capacity at major financial institutions.  Activity in the mortgage market reflected mainly refinancing, and staff estimates indicated that residential mortgage debt contracted again in the first quarter, depressed by the very low pace of home sales, falling house prices, and write downs of nonperforming loans.  Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast for the meeting, which was prepared prior to the release of the advance estimates of the first quarter national income and product accounts, the staff revised up its outlook for economic activity in response to recent favorable financial developments as well as better than expected readings on final sales.  Participants noted that financial market conditions had generally strengthened, and surveys and anecdotal reports pointed to a pickup in household and business confidence, which nonetheless remained at very low levels.  Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  The Committee anticipates that the combination of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":117},{"text":" Private nonfarm payroll employment registered its fifth consecutive large monthly decrease, with losses widespread across industries.  Some signs pointing toward economic stabilization were seen in data on consumer spending, housing, and factory orders.","id":117},{"text":" Business spending on equipment and software continued to fall across a broad range of categories.  Both headline and core consumer prices edged up in January and February.  Employment losses remained widespread across industries, with the notable exception of health care.  In real terms, investment declined for most types of buildings over the previous few months.  Imports of automotive products declined as automakers made significant production cutbacks throughout North America.  Economic activity in emerging market economies also weakened significantly in the fourth quarter.  Incoming data for January and February suggested a further significant decline in the first quarter.  Conditions in short term funding markets were mixed over the intermeeting period.  Businesses reported that bank financing was becoming more expensive and more difficult to obtain.  Several participants noted the tentative signs of stabilization in consumer spending in January and February.  Participants expressed a variety of views about the strength and timing of the recovery, however.  Treasury purchases were to be conducted over the next six months.","id":118},{"text":" Industrial production fell in January and February, with cutbacks again widespread, and capacity utilization in manufacturing declined to a very low level.  Conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market continued to improve, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Both exports and imports retreated significantly in the fourth quarter of last year and appeared headed for comparable declines this quarter.  However, for the most part, participants viewed conditions in financial markets as little changed but remaining extraordinarily stressed.  One member preferred to focus additional purchases on longer term Treasury securities, whereas another member preferred to focus on agency MBS.","id":118},{"text":" Credit conditions remained very tight, and financial markets remained fragile and unsettled, with pressures on financial institutions generally intensifying this year.  Against this backdrop, participants anticipated further employment cutbacks over coming months, though perhaps at a gradually diminishing rate.  Others, who saw recovery as delayed and potentially weak, were concerned about a possible further rise in the saving rate and a very slow improvement in financial conditions.  In the discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that substantial additional purchases of longer term assets eligible for open market operations would be appropriate.","id":118},{"text":" Although the stock of unsold new single family homes fell in January to its lowest level since 2003, inventories continued to move up relative to the slow pace of sales.  Over the previous 12 months, the pace of existing home sales declined much less than that of new home sales, reflecting in part increases in foreclosure related and other distressed sales.  After holding up surprisingly well through most of last year, outlays on nonresidential structures began to show declines consistent with the weak fundamentals for this sector.  The debt of the domestic private nonfinancial sector, which was about unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year, was estimated to have remained about flat in the first quarter.  In particular, European bank shares fell steeply as earnings reports for the fourth quarter came in weaker than expected and fears about the exposure of many western European banks to emerging Europe increased.  The Bank of England announced its intention to purchase substantial quantities of government and corporate bonds through its Asset Purchase Facility, after which yields on long term British gilts fell significantly.  Nonetheless, large inventories of unsold homes relative to sales and the prospect of a continued high level of distressed sales would continue to hold down residential investment in the near term.  Members also noted the recent launch of the TALF, and they agreed to include in the Committee s statement an indication that the range of assets accepted as eligible collateral for the TALF was likely to be expanded.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 15 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract.","id":118},{"text":" Conditions in repurchase agreement markets for most collateral types improved over the period, but volumes remained low.  The incoming data on business spending suggested that business investment in equipment and structures continued to decline.  Business capital spending was weakening in an environment of uncertainty and low business confidence.  The household saving rate, which had already risen considerably, would eventually level out and cease to hold back consumption growth.","id":118},{"text":" Some industries that previously were less affected, such as agriculture and energy, had begun to suffer the effects of the slowdown.  Several participants said that the degree and pervasiveness of the decline in foreign economic activity was one of the most notable developments since the January meeting.","id":118},{"text":" To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the United States dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.  Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  By unanimous vote, the Committee approved several amendments to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations (shown below).  The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.  In light of its program to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage backed securities, the Committee voted to suspend temporarily the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues (last amended January 28, 2003).  Mister Lacker dissented, stating that he views targeted purchases of agency debt and mortgage backed securities as distorting credit markets and would prefer that the Desk instead purchase Treasury securities.  The Manager also reported on System open market operations in Treasury securities and in agency debt and mortgage backed securities during the period since the Committee s December 15 16 meeting.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the period since the Committee s December 15 16 meeting.  Meeting participants discussed the potential benefits of conducting open market purchases of a substantial quantity of longer term Treasury securities for the System Open Market Account.  Participants generally agreed that purchasing such securities could be a useful adjunct to other monetary policy tools in some circumstances.  One participant preferred to begin purchasing Treasury securities immediately, as a way to increase the monetary base, in lieu of expanding programs that aim to support particular segments of the credit markets.  Other participants were prepared to purchase longer term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  System Liquidity Programs and Balance Sheet Staff reported on developments in System liquidity programs and on changes in the System s balance sheet since the Committee s December 15 16 meeting.  Participants observed that many of the Federal Reserve s liquidity programs are priced so that they will become unattractive to borrowers as conditions in financial markets improve; these programs will shrink automatically.  Participants also discussed the advisability of extending the termination dates of a number of temporary liquidity facilities and reciprocal currency arrangements from April 30 to October 30, 2009.  Following the discussion, the Committee voted unanimously to extend the termination dates of existing reciprocal currency arrangements and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) to October 30, 2009.  Headline consumer prices fell in November and December, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices; core consumer prices were about flat in those months.  The decrease in production of consumer goods reflected cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies as well as in the output of consumer durable goods such as appliances, furniture, and carpeting.  Output in high tech sectors contracted in the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced production of semiconductors, communications equipment, and computers.  Real spending on goods excluding motor vehicles was estimated to have fallen noticeably in December, more than reversing an increase in November.  Readings on consumer sentiment remained at very low levels by historical standards through the end of 2008 and showed little improvement in early January.  Single family housing starts dropped at a much faster rate in those months than they had in the first 10 months of the year.  Housing demand remained very weak and, although the stock of unsold new single family homes continued to move down in November, inventories of unsold homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales.  Orders and shipments for many types of equipment declined in October and November, and imports of capital goods dropped back in those months.  Construction spending related to petroleum refining and power generation and distribution continued to increase briskly in the second half of 2008, responding to the surge in energy prices in the first half of that year, but real investment for many types of buildings stagnated or declined.  In Canada, employment fell markedly in November and December after edging up in October.  Later in the period, the policy path tilted lower in response to weaker than expected economic data releases and increased concerns about the health of some financial institutions.  Although implied inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) increased over the period, this increase reportedly was largely attributable to improved trading conditions in the TIPS market rather than upward revisions to inflation expectations.  Conditions in short term funding markets showed some signs of easing, although significant stresses remained.  Conditions in the market for repo transactions backed by agency debt and mortgage backed securities also improved somewhat, with average bid asked spreads declining from high levels.  Trading volumes fell to very low levels at the end of 2008, although they recovered a bit after the end of the year.  Bid asked spreads in the on the run market declined sharply at the beginning of 2009 after having increased at the end of 2008.  The MMIFF continued to register no activity despite changes that eased some of the terms of the program.  The dollar amounts of outstanding unsecured financial and nonfinancial CP and ABCP rose slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Yields and spreads on corporate bonds decreased noticeably, particularly for speculative grade firms, but spreads remained high by historical standards.  Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial investment grade companies remained solid, but issuance of speculative grade bonds was limited.  Secondary market prices for leveraged loans stayed near record lows and the average bid asked spread in that market continued to be very wide.  CDS spreads for United States bank holding companies rose sharply in mid January to near their historical highs, and equity prices for such companies fell on net, ending the period below their November lows.  A number of banking organizations issued debt through the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; spreads on such debt declined to levels close to those on agency debt.  Debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth quarter of 2008 than in the first three quarters of the year.  Household debt appeared to have contracted in the fourth quarter, with both mortgage and consumer credit sharply curtailed due to weak household spending and tight credit conditions.  Commercial and industrial loans declined in November and December, likely reflecting a combination of tighter credit supply and reduced loan demand as well as some unwinding of the surge during September and October.  The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in January indicated that banks had continued to tighten credit standards and terms on all major loan categories over the past three months.  Survey respondents also indicated that they had reduced the size of credit lines for a wide range of existing business and household customers.  Flows into both demand deposits and savings deposits surged, possibly reflecting a reallocation of wealth towards assets that had government insurance or guarantees.  In their discussion of the economic and financial situation and the outlook for the economy, participants agreed that the economy had weakened further going into 2009.  Participants generally saw credit conditions as extremely tight, with financial markets fragile and some parts of the banking sector under substantial stress.  However, modest signs of improvement were evident in some financial markets particularly those that were receiving support from Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and other government actions.  Participants noted that consumers were continuing to cut back expenditures in response to sharply declining employment, further declines in wealth, and tighter credit conditions.  Some participants mentioned that business contacts had indicated that firms were reducing payrolls aggressively and also freezing wages and salaries, further restricting growth in personal income and thus probably damping consumer spending.  Looking ahead, participants anticipated that tax cuts and some other elements of the proposed fiscal stimulus package would add to after tax incomes and thus boost consumer spending, though the magnitude of the impetus was far from clear.  For example, unless the cuts were clearly perceived to be permanent, the boost to consumer spending might prove short lived, as was the case with the tax rebates distributed in the spring of 2008.  Lower house prices and mortgage rates had increased housing affordability, but concerns that house prices may fall further appeared to be holding back potential buyers.  Equipment investment had declined particularly sharply, reflecting weak sales, tighter credit, and substantial uncertainty about future economic conditions and government policies.  The fiscal stimulus bill, which was being considered by the Congress as the Committee met, would support state and local government spending as well as boost federal spending, helping to buoy demands for goods and services.  Participants generally thought that fiscal stimulus was a necessary and important complement to the steps the Federal Reserve and other agencies were taking, and that it would help foster economic recovery, but had questions about the details of the proposed legislation and the extent to which it would boost demands for and production of goods and services.  Participants indicated they had been surprised by the speed and magnitude of the slowdown in economic growth abroad and the resulting drop in demand for United States exports.  It was noted that the surprisingly sharp decline in both United States exports and imports might also reflect tight credit conditions, including the reduced availability of trade credit.  Participants agreed that inflation pressures had diminished appreciably in recent quarters, and they expected significantly lower headline and core inflation during the next few years than during recent years.  In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.  They also agreed to continue using liquidity and asset purchase programs to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy.  Members further agreed that these programs were likely to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet at a high level.  Members noted that it may be necessary to expand these programs, but had somewhat different views about the best way of doing so.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.  The focus of the Committee s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet at a high level.  The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.","id":119},{"text":" 3.  4.  3.  4.  3.  3.  4.","id":119},{"text":" Market participants also viewed monetary policy communications, on balance, as pointing to somewhat less restrictive policy than expected.

Regarding the economic outlook, participants generally judged that, in 2024, real GDP growth would cool and that rebalancing of the labor market would continue, with the unemployment rate rising somewhat from its current level.  They assessed that the contribution of improved supply had come from supply chain normalization, boosts to labor supply due to a higher labor force participation rate and immigration, better productivity growth, or increased domestic oil production.  All participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet.  Several participants remarked that the Committee s balance sheet plans indicated that it would slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged consistent with ample reserves.","id":0},{"text":" The labor force participation rate was essentially flat over the past two months, remaining above its level early in the year, while the employment to population ratio rose slightly on balance.

In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.","id":0},{"text":" Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined sharply over the intermeeting period more so at longer maturities after having increased notably during the previous intermeeting period, as investors appeared to interpret incoming data as reducing risks of prolonged inflation pressures.  The lessening of labor market imbalances was apparent in recent wage data, as the 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was well below its year earlier level and the Wage Growth Tracker constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was trending down and lower than a year ago.  A straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants expected the federal funds rate to be 25 basis points below its current level by the May 2024 FOMC meeting, two meetings earlier than at the time of the October November FOMC meeting.  The decline in usage primarily reflected money market mutual funds reallocating their assets to Treasury bills and private market repo, which offered slightly more attractive market rates relative to the ON RRP rate amid continued increases in net Treasury bill issuance and Federal Reserve balance sheet reduction.  Participants generally stressed the importance of maintaining a careful and data dependent approach to making monetary policy decisions and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation was clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee s objective.","id":0},{"text":" C I loan balances contracted through November, on balance, while expansion of commercial real estate (CRE) loans stepped down appreciably across most categories from an already moderating pace in the third quarter.

While CRE prices declined, valuations remained stretched, with capitalization rates remaining near historical lows.

Several participants added that delinquencies on auto loans and credit cards had risen for these households.","id":1},{"text":" The rise since July in yields on longer dated nominal Treasury securities was mostly attributable to increases in real yields.  Regarding balance sheet policy, the surveys showed that respondents had pushed out the date they expected balance sheet runoff to stop, perhaps partly in response to policymakers communications that balance sheet runoff could continue even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.  The manager also noted that 23 banks, in addition to all primary dealers, were already counterparties to the standing repo facility (SRF) and that several more were in the onboarding process.  Easing labor market imbalances were apparent in the wage data, with the 12 month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index each below their year earlier levels.  Longer term sovereign bond yields for advanced foreign economies rose, foreign equity prices declined, foreign credit spreads generally widened, and investors continued to withdraw from emerging market economy funds.  That decline primarily reflected money market funds reducing their usage of the facility and increasing their holdings of Treasury bills and private market repos in response to slightly more attractive rates on these alternative investments.  However, smaller firms were finding it harder to obtain credit, with the share of small firms reporting in September that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier rising from an already elevated level.  Meanwhile, outstanding student loan balances declined significantly in August, driven by the cancellation of student loan debt for certain borrowers.  The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond market remained sound overall, albeit with pockets of deterioration.  The staff also expected output in the fourth quarter to be temporarily restrained by the autoworkers strike before being boosted in the first quarter as lost production begins to be made up.  With the lagged effects of monetary policy actions expected to restrain activity, real GDP was projected to rise more slowly than the staff s estimate of potential over the next two years before rising in line with potential in 2026.  The unemployment rate was expected to be roughly flat through 2026 as the effects of below potential output growth were offset by the effects of further improvements in labor market functioning.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that the incoming data on consumer spending had again surprised to the upside, likely supported by a strong labor market and by generally solid household balance sheets.  Nevertheless, some participants remarked that the finances of some households especially those in the low and moderate income categories were increasingly coming under pressure amid high prices for food and other essentials as well as tight credit conditions.  A couple of these participants commented that the aggregate household sector may have more financial resources than previously thought, which could help account for the strength in spending.  A few participants observed that activity in the housing sector had flattened out in recent months, likely reflecting the effects of further increases in mortgage rates from already elevated levels.  Business fixed investment was flat in the third quarter, and participants observed that conditions reported by their business contacts varied across industries and Districts.  Several participants noted that an increasing number of District businesses were reporting that higher interest rates were affecting their businesses or that firms were increasingly cutting or delaying their investment plans because of higher borrowing costs and tighter bank lending conditions.  A few participants observed that higher interest rates were also affecting the agricultural sector, with their contacts noting that high financing costs were likely weighing on purchases of heavy agricultural equipment.  Measures of labor supply had moved up, with the labor force participation rate for prime age workers rising this year, especially for women, and immigration also boosting labor supply.  A few participants expressed concern that the recent pace of increases in labor supply might not be sustainable in light of challenges regarding the availability of childcare and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which immigration would continue to boost the growth of labor supply.  In their discussion of financial stability, participants observed that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stresses had subsided.  A few participants also discussed the importance of monitoring Treasury market functioning and potential vulnerabilities posed by the amount of leverage being used by hedge funds in this market.  In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants noted that economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter and had been resilient.  While the labor market remained tight, job gains had moderated, on balance, since earlier in the year, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance.  Amid these economic conditions, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 percent at this meeting.  All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet.  Participants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee s inflation objective was insufficient.  Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing, aggregate demand was moderating in the face of tighter financial and credit conditions, and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply.  All participants judged that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee s objective.  Several participants commented on the recent decline in the use of the ON RRP facility, noting that the use of the facility had been responsive to market conditions.  Such risks included potentially larger than expected effects of the tightening in financial and credit conditions on aggregate demand and on bank, business, and household balance sheets; continued weakness in the CRE sector; and potential disruptions to global oil markets.  In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and mortgage backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.  Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest into agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.","id":1},{"text":" Labor demand and supply were slowly moving into better alignment.

Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  Wholesale borrowing by large banks increased over the intermeeting period.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.","id":2},{"text":" Bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period, but credit to businesses and households remained generally accessible.  Participants stressed that current inflation remained unacceptably high while acknowledging that it had moderated somewhat over the past year.","id":2},{"text":" United States data releases generally pointed to greater economic resilience than previously thought, and the reaction in market pricing implied both a higher expected trajectory for the policy rate at longer horizons and higher term premiums.  Bank equity prices underperformed over the period, but taking a somewhat longer view, investor sentiment toward the banking sector appeared to have largely stabilized, with less differentiation of equity price movements across bank types.  Increased supply of money market instruments, especially Treasury bills, contributed to a slight increase in money market rates, which appeared to induce money funds to shift away from ON RRP toward other instruments.  The easing of labor market imbalances was also evident in the recent wage data, with the 12 month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index, and the four quarter change in business sector compensation per hour all lower than their year earlier levels.  Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as troubles in the property sector weighed on economic activity in China and monetary policy restraint contributed to the slowing in economic growth in Europe.  Market participants pointed to a range of factors that may have contributed to the increase in longer term forward rates, including higher term premiums and upward revisions to market views of the likely path of Treasury debt over time.  The staff assumed that GDP growth for the rest of this year would be damped a bit by the autoworkers strike, with these effects unwound by a small boost to GDP growth next year.  The unemployment rate was projected to remain roughly flat through 2026, as upward pressure from below potential output growth was offset by downward pressure from further improvements in labor market functioning.  Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and that it broadly appeared to be restraining the economy as intended.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that aggregate consumer spending had continued to exhibit considerable strength, supported by the strong labor market and by generally strong household balance sheets.  Some participants noted that housing demand was resilient despite higher interest rates; new home construction was solid, in part reflecting the limited inventory of homes available for sale.  Several participants judged that, over coming quarters, business activity would be restrained by tighter financial conditions, such as higher interest rates and more constrained access to bank credit.  Several participants noted, however, that the tightening of credit conditions resulting from the banking stresses earlier in the year was likely to be less severe than they previously expected.  Many participants commented that they expected that the autoworkers strike would, in the near term, result in a slowdown in production of motor vehicles and parts and possibly put upward pressure on automobile prices, but that these effects would be temporary.  With respect to the agricultural sector, a few participants noted that conditions were mixed, as crop prices had declined amid higher production estimates and as supply and demand imbalances pushed up the prices of some types of livestock and held down the prices of others.  All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet.  Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply.  Some participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly to the public about the Committee s data dependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  A few participants noted that the pace at which inflation was returning to the Committee s 2 percent goal would influence their views of the sufficiently restrictive level of the policy rate and how long to keep policy restrictive.  Several participants commented that, with the policy rate likely at or near its peak, the focus of monetary policy decisions and communications should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels.  Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify to the public how participants assessed the likely evolution of the stance of monetary policy.  Several participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time, even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.  Such risks included larger than anticipated lagged macroeconomic effects from the tightening in financial conditions, the effect of labor union strikes, slowing global growth, and continued weakness in the CRE sector.  Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace, and, accordingly, that the corresponding language in the postmeeting statement should be changed from moderate to solid.  In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and mortgage backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.  Effective September 21, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 percent.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.  Reinvest into agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.

Most survey respondents had a modal expectation that a July rate hike would be the last of this tightening cycle, although most respondents also perceived that additional monetary policy tightening after the July FOMC meeting was possible.  The overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued to work as intended over the intermeeting period and had been instrumental in providing an effective floor under the federal funds rate and supporting other money market rates; those rates remained stable over the period.  Following the suspension of the debt ceiling in early June, the Treasury Department issued securities, notably Treasury bills, to replenish the Treasury General Account (TGA).  In the July Desk Survey of Primary Dealers, respondents expected lower ON RRP balances and higher bank reserves by the end of the year, compared with the June survey.  Short term interest rates in the AFEs increased modestly, on net, over the intermeeting period as foreign central banks continued to raise policy rates and signal the potential for further tightening.  The staff s trade weighted broad dollar index declined moderately, with the largest moves following releases of weaker than expected United States labor market data and lower than expected United States inflation data.  In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained elevated by historical standards.  The July SLOOS also indicated that standards across all CRE loan categories tightened further in the second quarter and that banks expected to tighten CRE standards further over the second half of the year.  Only modest net percentages of banks in the July SLOOS reported tightening standards for mortgage loans eligible to be purchased by government sponsored enterprises, while a moderate net percentage of banks reported expecting to tighten lending standards further for these loans over the second half of the year.  While nonfinancial businesses remained highly leveraged and thus vulnerable to shocks, firms debt growth has been relatively subdued recently, and their ability to service that debt has been quite high, even among lower rated firms.  A gradual slowdown in economic activity nevertheless appeared to be in progress, consistent with the restraint placed on demand by the cumulative tightening of monetary policy since early last year and the associated effects on financial conditions.  Participants commented that monetary policy tightening appeared to be working broadly as intended and that a continued gradual slowing in real GDP growth would help reduce demand supply imbalances in the economy.  Participants cited other factors that were likely leading to, or appeared consistent with, a slowdown in consumption, including the declining stock of excess savings, softening labor market conditions, and increased price sensitivity on the part of customers.  Participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand and supply in the labor market was needed, and they expected that additional softening in labor market conditions would take place over time.  Various participants commented on risks that could affect some banks, including unrealized losses on assets resulting from rising interest rates, significant reliance on uninsured deposits, and increased funding costs.  Participants noted that this action would put the stance of monetary policy further into restrictive territory, consistent with reducing demand supply imbalances in the economy and helping to restore price stability.  A couple of participants indicated that they favored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal.  Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and product and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply.  Effective July 27, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 percent.

Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent favorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee s 2 percent longer term objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households low income families in particular.

The vast majority of respondents to the Open Market Desk s Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants expected no rate change at this meeting.  Respondents average probability distribution for the level of the peak policy rate shifted higher since the May meeting and respondents on average assigned about 60 percent probability to the peak being above the current target range.  The median respondent to the Desk surveys expected the three month bill yield to increase slightly relative to the similar maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rate and to remain above it into the fourth quarter.  The staff assessed that the replenishment of the TGA and the ongoing balance sheet runoff, among other factors, were likely to subtract from reserves more than the decline in ON RRP participation would add to them.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  In aggregate, the labor force participation rate held steady in April and May, and the employment to population ratio ticked down.  The private sector job openings rate in April as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was unchanged from its relatively high first quarter average, though it was lower than a year earlier.  Over the 12 months ending in May, average hourly earnings for all employees increased 4.3 percent, below its peak of 5.9 percent early last year.  Over the year ending in the first quarter, compensation per hour in the business sector increased 3.2 percent, down from 5.5 percent a year earlier.  Foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter, reflecting in part the reopening of China s economy from its COVID 19 related shutdowns and strong services sector activity in other Asian countries, Canada, and Mexico.  Indicators pointed to a step down in the pace of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, with the impetus from China s reopening dissipating and global manufacturing activity remaining weak.  Global prices for energy and agricultural commodities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, while prices for metals fell further.  The expected path of the policy rate implied by market quotes moved up notably over the intermeeting period.  A straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants expected that the federal funds rate would be roughly flat over the course of the rest of this year.  The year end expected rate was about 70 basis points higher than the year end expectation before the May FOMC meeting.  The S P 500 stock price index increased sizably, on net, over the intermeeting period, led by technology related stocks.  Notwithstanding the rise in global yields, foreign equity prices, credit spreads, and risk sentiment in foreign markets were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period.  The 25 basis point increase in administered rates at the May FOMC meeting fully passed through to overnight money market rates.  In May, yields of Treasury bills maturing in June and thus potentially affected by the federal debt limit rose sharply before largely retracing those increases after an agreement was reached to suspend the debt limit.  In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities increased notably over the intermeeting period.  Interest rates on credit card offers continued to rise through April, and auto loan interest rates moved sideways during the intermeeting period.  Both credit card and auto loan interest rates stood at, or near, their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis.  Issuance of nonfinancial investment grade corporate bonds rose at a robust pace in May after slowing in April, partly due to the earnings blackout period.  Leveraged loan issuance remained subdued, reflecting weak investor demand amid concerns over the credit worthiness of borrowers.  Credit remained easily available in the residential mortgage market for high credit score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.  In consumer credit markets, conditions stayed generally accommodative, with credit available for most borrowers.  Given the continued strength in labor market conditions and the resilience of consumer spending, however, the staff saw the possibility of the economy continuing to grow slowly and avoiding a downturn as almost as likely as the mild recession baseline.  They assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions and lower demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and business investment.  Participants also acknowledged uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and discussed the extent to which the full effects of monetary tightening on the economy had been realized.  Participants generally noted that banking stresses had receded and conditions in the banking sector were much improved since early March.  Several participants mentioned that credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened significantly beyond what would be expected in response to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year.  Several participants noted that aggregate household wealth remained high, as equity and home prices had not declined much from their recent highs.  Some participants remarked that the effect of high interest rates on the housing sector appeared to be bottoming out, with home sales, builder sentiment, and new construction all having improved a little since the start of the year.  Similarly, a few participants noted that their District contacts reported less difficulty in hiring and retaining workers, lower turnover rates, and some layoffs.  Participants anticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, consistent with their projections of below trend economic growth.  Several participants cited the possibility of delayed effects of tighter credit conditions potentially contributing to a slowdown in economic activity that reduces inflationary pressures.  The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low, but there were some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance.  Most of these participants observed that leaving the target range unchanged at this meeting would allow them more time to assess the economy s progress toward the Committee s goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Some participants indicated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a proposal.  All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet.  Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.  In support of these goals, the members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1/4 percent.  Effective June 15, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 to 5 1/4 percent.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.05 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month.  Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest into agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1/4 percent.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.","id":4},{"text":" Participants expected supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing pressures on wages and prices.

All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective.","id":5},{"text":" Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the May 2 3 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter.  Credit flows for businesses and households slowed moderately, as high borrowing costs and market volatility amid stress in the banking sector appeared to weigh on financing volumes in some markets.  Some participants noted that small businesses tend to rely on small and mid sized banks as primary sources of credit and therefore may disproportionally bear the effects of tighter lending conditions.","id":5},{"text":" The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, and the increase of 25 basis points in the Federal Reserve s administered rates following the March FOMC meeting fully passed through to overnight money market rates.  In terms of financial sector leverage, going into the period of recent bank stress, banks of all sizes appeared strong, with substantial loss absorbing capacity as measured by regulatory capital ratios well above levels that prevailed before the Great Recession.  For the nonbank sector, leverage at large hedge funds remained somewhat elevated in the third quarter of 2022, and more recent data from the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms suggested this fact had not changed.  A few participants remarked that there had been some ongoing reduction in consumers discretionary expenditures in the face of elevated inflation and higher borrowing rates, especially among lower and middle income households; some of those declines were reportedly driven by shifts in purchases toward lower cost options.  Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was subdued in the first quarter, reflecting relatively high borrowing costs, weak growth of business sector output, and businesses increasing concerns about the general economic outlook.  In discussing sources of downside risk to economic activity, participants referenced the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could affect economic activity more than expected, and that further strains in the banking sector could prove more substantial than anticipated.  Some participants also noted concerns that the statutory limit on federal debt might not be raised in a timely manner, threatening significant disruptions to the financial system and tighter financial conditions that weaken the economy.  However, a few participants cited the possibility that further tightening of credit conditions could slow household spending and reduce business investment and hiring, all of which would support the ongoing rebalancing of supply and demand in product and labor markets and reduce inflation pressures.  A few participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for United States Treasury securities or stressed the importance of the appropriate authorities continuing to address issues related to the resilience of the market.  In discussing the policy outlook, participants generally agreed that in light of the lagged effects of cumulative tightening in monetary policy and the potential effects on the economy of a further tightening in credit conditions, the extent to which additional increases in the target range may be appropriate after this meeting had become less certain.  One such factor was the degree and timing with which cumulative policy tightening restrained economic activity and reduced inflation, with some participants commenting that they saw evidence that the past years tightening was beginning to have its intended effect.  Some participants stressed that it was crucial to communicate that the language in the postmeeting statement should not be interpreted as signaling either that decreases in the target range are likely this year or that further increases in the target range had been ruled out.","id":5},{"text":" Market participants broadly expected a 25 basis point rate increase at the May meeting and saw the resulting rate as the likely peak for the current tightening cycle.  The private sector job openings rate as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey moved down markedly during February and March but remained high.  In the April SLOOS, banks reported further tightening of standards for most loan categories over the past three months, following widespread tightening in previous quarters.  Banks also reported that they expected to tighten CRE standards further over the remainder of the year, with mid sized banks very broadly reporting this expectation.  Overall, the credit quality of most businesses and households remained solid but deteriorated somewhat for businesses with lower credit ratings and for households with lower credit scores.  Rising borrowing costs had contributed to a moderation of price pressures in housing markets, and year over year house price increases had decelerated.  Participants generally expected real GDP to grow at a pace below its longer run trend rate in 2023, reflecting the effects of restrictive financial conditions.  Participants generally noted that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies in response to developments in the banking sector had been effective in largely reducing stress.  Many participants mentioned that it is essential that the debt limit be raised in a timely manner to avoid the risk of severely adverse dislocations in the financial system and the broader economy.

Participants agreed that the United States banking system remained sound and resilient.","id":6},{"text":" In response, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening, al though some have either paused or indicated that a pause soon was possible, citing the importance of assessing the cumulative effects of past policy rate increases.  Additionally, for the intermeeting period overall, the staff s dollar index rose moderately, corporate and emerging market economy sovereign credit spreads widened, and foreign equity indexes generally moved lower, with bank equities falling notably.  Some participants noted that given persistently high inflation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a 50 basis point increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector.","id":6},{"text":" The VIX the one month option implied volatility on the S P 500 increased to about 26.5 percent following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but it subsequently declined to 21 percent around the 70th percentile of its historical distribution.  Since the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, spreads on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans rose, with speculative grade corporate bond spreads registering the largest moves; spreads remained at moderate levels relative to their historical distributions.  Participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect of a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation, and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening.  However, a few participants mentioned that their nonbank business contacts reported that the banking sector developments so far had not resulted in significant changes in their hiring and capital spending plans or sales expectations, though their contacts also acknowledged increased uncertainties around their outlooks.","id":6},{"text":" Borrowing from the new Bank Term Funding Program had been small relative to discount window borrowing, which had increased to record levels.

The trade deficit had been narrowing since March of last year but resumed widening in December and January.  The credit quality of businesses and households was largely stable over the intermeeting period.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.","id":6},{"text":" Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market based measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in May 2023 and that the target range would then move lower.  Federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks.  Use of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility fell, especially for money market mutual funds (MMFs), as the supply of short term securities at attractive rates increased.  They also noted, however, that the developments in the banking sector that had occurred late in the intermeeting period affected their views of the economic and policy outlook and the uncertainty surrounding that outlook.  Participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.  As a source of upside risk to inflation, participants cited the possibility of more persistent than anticipated price pressures, due to, for example, surprisingly resilient labor demand.","id":6},{"text":" Use of United States dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks had been minimal, indicating that market participants did not face significant difficulties in obtaining dollar funding from private sources.  At the same time, though, participants noted that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate had remained low.  Several participants noted the importance of longer term inflation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  Recent indicators of nominal wage growth had slowed but continued to be elevated.

Nevertheless, generally solid funding flows suggest that most firms and households had remained broadly able to access funding.","id":6},{"text":" U.S. unsecured funding markets showed some signs of pressure later in the intermeeting period.  Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff s estimate of its natural rate early next year.  Regarding prices for core services excluding housing, participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2 00 p.m.","id":6},{"text":" Market participants generally expected usage of the ON RRP facility to continue a downward trend in 2023, moderating the decline in reserve balances as the Federal Reserve s holdings of securities continue to run off.  In particular, the Treasury could increase bill issuance to rebuild TGA balances once the debt limit is lifted, reducing reserves and potentially lifting money market rates.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the December increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve s administered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates.  Residential mortgage rates were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained well above their levels in the previous tightening cycle, notwithstanding the decline from their peak in early November.  In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported having tightened C I and commercial real estate (CRE) lending standards over the previous three months.  In particular, the staff noted that measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high, and that the potential for large declines in property prices remained greater than usual.  Participants agreed that they had observed less evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of prices for core services excluding housing, a category that accounts for more than half of the core PCE price index.  They noted, however, that such pressures, should they occur, would likely cause an upward re pricing of private money market rates that could encourage market participants to reduce their use of the facility.  Effective February 2, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4 1/2 to 4 3/4 percent.

Several participants remarked that the recent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow; a couple of those participants noted that businesses appeared more confident that significant supply bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore choose to hold smaller inventories.  Nevertheless, participants noted tentative signs that imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market were improving, with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels, the average number of hours worked falling, and growth in wages and employment costs slowing.  Participants noted that core goods prices had declined notably over the previous few months as supply bottlenecks had eased but anticipated that price declines for this component would dissipate as the downward pressure on goods prices from resolving supply bottlenecks fades.  Al though several participants noted that the Federal Reserve s standing liquidity facilities could be helpful in addressing significant pressures in funding markets, should they arise, several participants also noted the challenges of addressing potential disruptions in United States core market functioning.  The participants favoring a 50 basis point increase noted that a larger increase would more quickly bring the target range close to the levels they believed would achieve a sufficiently restrictive stance, taking into account their views of the risks to achieving price stability in a timely way.","id":7},{"text":" Regarding production, United States manufacturing output declined sizably in both November and December.  Lending standards tightened further for bank dependent borrowers.  Leveraged loans experienced notable net rating downgrades in December, but the pace moderated in January.  Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate.  However, several participants observed that some measures of financial conditions had eased over the past few months.  Members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.","id":7},{"text":" Foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the COVID 19 related slowdown in China and repercussions of Russia s war against Ukraine.  The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the United States financial system as moderate.  A number of participants commented that supply bottlenecks continued to ease, al though supply chain issues remained a challenge in some sectors.  A couple of participants observed that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures.  In that adverse scenario, it would be more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Committee s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.","id":7},{"text":" The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio edged up.  Both inventories and net exports are volatile categories in aggregate spending.

Money market rates were stable over the period, with the year end passing smoothly.","id":7},{"text":" With core inflation remaining elevated amid tight labor markets, however, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy.  Broad stock price indexes ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher despite sizable fluctuations.  Credit remained broadly available for businesses and households with strong credit quality but remained tight for lower rated borrowers.  Assets in open end mutual funds that invest in less liquid instruments like bank loans or high yield corporate bonds have declined notably over the past year.  Participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing.","id":7},{"text":" Participants observed that the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was high.  Participants discussed the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity.","id":7},{"text":" Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, close to the pace recorded in the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector over the 12 months ending in September.  The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes ended the intermeeting period lower, largely reflecting data releases that pointed to a larger than expected moderation in inflation.  Broad financial conditions were projected to be somewhat less restrictive than previously assumed, as the effects of a higher path for equity values and a lower path for the dollar more than offset a higher medium term trajectory for interest rates.  Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further, housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while core non housing services inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased.  A couple of participants remarked on anecdotes or concerns from builder contacts about contract cancellations by purchasers no longer able to qualify for loans at higher interest rates.  Several participants commented that they saw diminished risks of severe disruption from the European Union s embargo and the Group of Seven s price cap on Russian oil exports.  Participants generally concluded that there remained a large imbalance between labor supply and labor demand, as indicated by the still large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth.  Under an appropriately restrictive path of monetary policy, participants expected labor market supply and demand to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on nominal wages and prices.  In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy.","id":8},{"text":" Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, both market and Desk survey based measures indicated expectations for the Committee to maintain elevated policy rates through 2023.  In addition, banks increased CRE originations to multifamily and industrial properties relative to office properties, reflecting caution in the context of rising office vacancies.  While delinquency rates on credit cards remained low relative to their historical range, those on auto loans surpassed their pre pandemic peak.  Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.","id":8},{"text":" In contrast, residential investment looked to be contracting sharply further, and growth in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing markedly, with tepid gains in equipment and intangibles spending and continued declines in nonresidential structures investment.  Several participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving, including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022 as well as reports from District contacts that they were seeing more qualified job applicants for open positions than earlier in the year.  Nevertheless, they noted that some other measures of employment such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages suggested that job growth in 2022 may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment.  In the context of achieving the Committee s broad based and inclusive maximum employment goal, a number of participants commented that as the labor market moved into better balance, the unemployment rate for some demographic groups particularly African Americans and Hispanics would likely increase by more than the national average.  Participants observed that a slowing in the pace of rate increases at this meeting would better allow the Committee to assess the economy s progress toward the Committee s goals of maximum employment and price stability, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals.  The other risk was that the lagged cumulative effect of policy tightening could end up being more restrictive than is necessary to bring down inflation to 2 percent and lead to an unnecessary reduction in economic activity, potentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.  In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.","id":8},{"text":" Stock market indexes rose, on balance, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the inflation outlook, and market volatility declined notably.

Real goods exports fell, led by declines in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods.","id":8},{"text":" Both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio declined a little over the past two months.  Bank credit data also indicate that the expansion in credit card balances continued in October before slowing in early November.  Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained at very low levels.  The credit quality of businesses that borrow from banks remained sound on balance.  Participants also discussed the developments in energy and agricultural sectors.  No participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin reducing the federal funds rate target in 2023.","id":8},{"text":" In contrast, interest rates in credit card offers continued to increase, reflecting the higher prime rate that was quickly passed through.

Issuance of investment grade corporate bonds rebounded somewhat in late October and November from earlier subdued levels, while speculative grade issuance remained soft.  Several participants remarked that budgets were stretched for low to moderate income households and that many consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives.  Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time.","id":8},{"text":" Elevated volatility in international financial markets contributed to volatility in United States core fixed income markets.  The manager pro tem turned next to developments in money markets and Federal Reserve operations.  Government purchases rose in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year.  In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed signs of deterioration in some sectors but remained generally solid overall.  Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity.  Several participants, however, commented on signs of a moderation in nominal wage growth.  Participants discussed a number of risk management considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy.

These participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further.  Several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks.","id":9},{"text":" Delinquencies on residential mortgage loans continued to trend down, and the share of mortgages in foreclosure in August remained close to pre pandemic levels.

Money market fund net yields rose along with the rise in administered rates, while retail bank deposit rates increased modestly on balance.  These conditions were creating new supply constraints and putting upward pressures on transportation costs and prices for farm products.  They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.","id":9},{"text":" The increased volatility appeared to contribute to a decline in measures of market liquidity in core fixed income markets, in particular around the period associated with U.K. volatility, but market functioning remained orderly.  Recent developments, including with regard to the relationship between ON RRP facility balances and money market rates, suggested that, over time, conditions could evolve in a manner that would lead to falling usage of the ON RRP facility.  Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid Average hourly earnings rose 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the employment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.2 percent over this period.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the September increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve s administered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates.  In secured markets, money market rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, attributed to subdued Treasury bill supply, elevated demand for Treasury collateral, and investor demand for very short term assets amid uncertainty over the pace of policy rate increases.  Broad financial conditions were expected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in September, reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staff s assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent Federal Reserve communications.  Participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth, and some participants remarked that there had been a notable slowing in interest rate sensitive sectors, particularly housing, in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the Committee s policy actions.  In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for United States Treasury securities for the transmission of monetary policy, for meeting the financing needs of the federal government, and for the operation of the global financial system.  Nevertheless, with realized inflation well above that goal and the labor market still very tight, participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate and would help keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored.  A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee s goals, it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.8 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.

The private sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved lower, on net, from July to September but remained high.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, United States Treasury yields and the market implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher.  Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to trend upward, reflecting increases in the federal funds rate that were quickly passed through to prime rates.  Participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions, along with energy prices and other headwinds, was contributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real GDP.","id":9},{"text":" Weaker global demand has also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in export oriented emerging market economies in Asia.  Consumer credit remained available for most borrowers in July and August, with auto credit and credit card credit growing at a robust pace.  Participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the Committee s strong commitment to returning inflation to the 2 percent objective.","id":9},{"text":" Equity issuance and gross issuance of municipal bonds remained weak in September and October.  Short term funding markets continued to have structural vulnerabilities.","id":9},{"text":" The market implied path of the federal funds rate shifted sharply higher after market participants interpreted Federal Reserve communications particularly those provided at the Jackson Hole symposium along with incoming data, as indicating a more restrictive path of policy than previously expected.  Policy sensitive rates suggested that a 75 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was widely expected to be decided on at the Committee s September meeting, with some chance of a 100 basis point move.  Although secured overnight rates firmed slightly later in the intermeeting period, they remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate a configuration that market participants attributed to relatively low Treasury bill supply combined with strong investor demand for short dated instruments amid uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate.  Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose notably over the intermeeting period as major central banks raised their policy rates and communicated a tighter stance of future policy in the face of persistent inflationary pressures.  By contrast, credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose over the second quarter, particularly among subprime borrowers, with subprime auto loan delinquency rates rebounding notably to slightly above their historical averages.  In addition to Russia s war in Ukraine, weakening activity abroad, and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater than assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity.  These participants also noted that the composition of spending by low to moderate income households who were affected to a greater degree by high food, energy, and shelter prices was changing, with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lower cost options.  A couple of participants noted that businesses were constrained in undertaking new capital projects, as they faced higher financing costs, persistent challenges associated with supply bottlenecks, and hiring difficulties resulting from the continued tightness of the labor market.  Many participants remarked that their business contacts were reporting signs of relief in supply bottlenecks, such as declines in shipping costs and delivery times and rising inventories, while several participants saw little improvement in the supply situation.  Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May.  Policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee s monetary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to 2 percent.  Many participants noted that, with inflation well above the Committee s 2 percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing, they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee s goals.  Several participants noted that, particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environment, it would be important to calibrate the pace of further policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook.  Participants noted that, in keeping with the Committee s Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet, balance sheet runoff had moved up to its maximum planned pace in September and would continue at that pace.  A few of these participants noted that this possibility was heightened by factors beyond the Committee s actions, including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook, that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead.","id":10},{"text":" The exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably, reaching multidecade highs in real terms, as market participants perceived mounting economic challenges abroad.  Market participants generally anticipated a further slowing in the pace of rate increases after December, with the peak policy rate being reached in the first half of 2023.  Recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflation as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained elevated.  The private sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved slightly lower from May to July but remained at a high level.  Altogether, net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the July increase in the Federal Reserve s administered interest rates passing through quickly to other money market rates.  The United States dollar appreciated further against most major currencies, reaching multi decade highs against the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.  Interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher, in line with the rise in the federal funds rate, and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through August.  Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds slowed further in July from the weak levels seen in the second quarter but rebounded somewhat in August and so far in September.  The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside on the grounds that supply conditions might not improve as much as expected and energy prices might rise sharply again.  Participants observed that recent indicators of consumer spending and business investment suggested modest increases in those spending categories but noted that activity in interest sensitive sectors weakened appreciably.  Participants saw supply bottlenecks as likely continuing for a while longer, and a couple commented that constraints on production were increasingly taking the form of labor shortages rather than parts shortages.","id":10},{"text":" Credit in the residential mortgage market remained available for high credit score borrowers.  Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.  Participants discussed how they perceived challenging supply conditions to be evolving.

The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2 00 p.m.  Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production.  Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.","id":10},{"text":" However, the volumes of both home purchase and refinance mortgage originations plunged in July amid rising mortgage rates.  Several commented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation.","id":10},{"text":" The labor force participation rate and employment to population ratio both rose, on net, from June to August.  In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period.","id":10},{"text":" Weaker growth in China and the broader global economy also weighed on export oriented emerging market economies in Asia.  Total PCE price inflation was expected to decline to 2.6 percent in 2023 as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined.  Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.  Participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial increases in real interest rates across the maturity spectrum.  Many participants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action.  They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.","id":10},{"text":" The market implied federal funds rate path for the next few meetings rose but moved down noticeably at longer horizons.  Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and was well above the Committee s longer run goal of 2 percent.  Participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth as primarily being to the downside.","id":11},{"text":" In the euro area, peripheral sovereign spreads were little changed following the widely anticipated announcement by the European Central Bank of its Transmission Protection Instrument that could be activated to counter disorderly conditions in euro area bond markets.  However, respondents in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated increased concerns about credit quality in the near future as reasons for their expectation of a tightening in lending standards over the second half of 2022.  The staff assessed that households were in a better position than in the mid 2000s to weather a downturn in house prices, noting that mortgage debt growth has significantly lagged growth in house prices, leaving households with substantial equity cushions.  Recent declines in bank capital ratios were due to higher volatility, interest rate increases, and loan growth, but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums, and some banks were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year.  The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside, noting that supply chain bottlenecks, Russia s war against Ukraine, weak incoming data on spending, and the tightening in financial conditions since the start of the year supported this assessment.  These downside risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated, that there would be further pandemic related economic disruptions, or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances.  Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May.  Amid evidence that COVID related lockdowns in China had generally been lifted and had affected supply chains only modestly, members generally considered it appropriate to omit from the July statement the sentence that appeared in the June statement indicating that these lockdowns were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.  In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.  Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals.  In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.","id":11},{"text":" Market based measures of near dated inflation compensation declined and continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters.  The deputy manager next turned to a discussion of money markets and Desk operations.  The labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio both ticked down in June.  Small businesses that borrow on a regular basis faced notably higher borrowing costs in June.  Interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward.  Declining risk appetite has also led to sharp declines in the price of some digital assets.  The staff assessed that leverage in the financial sector remained moderate.  With respect to the business sector, participants noted that investment spending had likely declined in the second quarter.  Several participants observed that the moderation in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity.  Some participants commented on the financial stability challenges posed by digital assets.  A few participants mentioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regulation of certain types of nonbank financial institutions.  Participants agreed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for sustaining a strong labor market.  Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.","id":11},{"text":" The unemployment rate for African Americans moved lower in June, while the rate for Hispanics was unchanged; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average.  In domestic credit markets, longer term borrowing costs for households and businesses with higher credit ratings declined over the intermeeting period but borrowing costs for lower rated firms were higher, on net.  C I loans on banks books continued to grow robustly, with the July SLOOS citing reasons of increased demand by customers to finance inventory and accounts receivable.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data, and hearing reports from business contacts, of slower growth in consumer spending.  Participants anticipated that this slowdown in housing activity would continue and also expected higher borrowing costs to lead to a slowing in other interest sensitive household expenditures, such as purchases of durable goods.  Participants also observed that in some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.  In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee s objectives.  With inflation remaining well above the Committee s objective, participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  Participants pointed to some evidence suggesting that policy actions and communications about the future path of the federal funds rate were starting to affect the economy, most visibly in interest sensitive sectors.

The deputy manager ended with an update on SOMA net income.  Sovereign yields in AFEs declined notably.  The labor market, however, remained strong.","id":11},{"text":" The 75 basis point increase in the target range at the June meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other overnight rates.  Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June.  Real goods imports continued to step down from the exceptionally strong March readings, driven by declines in imports of consumer goods and capital goods.  Survey based measures of short run inflation expectations remained elevated; by contrast, some measures of longer term inflation expectations moved lower in recent weeks.  Declines in interest rates likely supported stock prices over the period, while some positive earnings releases suggested to investors a less pessimistic corporate outlook.  Spreads on municipal bonds widened slightly as yields declined by less than those of comparable maturity Treasury securities.  Credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose somewhat over the first quarter but remained subdued by recent historical standards.  Equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment, reflecting concerns over slower growth and lower risk appetite in corporate markets.  Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.  Participants also observed that housing activity had weakened notably, reflecting the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and house prices on home affordability.  In addition, although nominal wage growth remained strong according to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down.  Participants also noted that the high cost of living was an especially great burden on low and middle income households.  Several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some areas but that market functioning had, nonetheless, been orderly.  Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.","id":11},{"text":" Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased moderately over the year ending in the third quarter, while the 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees remained low in October and November.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation The risks associated with the fiscal and financial difficulties in Europe remained the focus of attention in financial markets over the intermeeting period and contributed to heightened volatility in a wide range of asset markets.  The aggregate volume of credit card solicitations in recent months remained at levels comparable to those before the financial crisis in 2008, though the volume sent to low income households was still well below the levels at that time.  Near the end of the period, sovereign spreads widened again amid market participants apparent concerns that the actions announced at the EU summit would prove to be less effective than they previously had anticipated.  The factors that participants cited as likely to restrain the pace of the economic expansion included an expectation that financial markets would remain unsettled until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area were more fully addressed.  A few participants thought that the recent strength in motor vehicle sales and other consumer spending could reflect pent up demand from households for goods and services, and so thought that it might persist for a time.  Participants generally saw few signs of recovery in the housing market, with house prices continuing to decline in most areas and the overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties still substantial.  Others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market.  However, a couple of participants expressed the concern that a statement that was sufficiently nuanced to capture the diversity of views on the Committee might not, in fact, enhance public understanding of the Committee s actions and intentions.","id":96},{"text":" Industrial production rose in October, reflecting in part a rebound in motor vehicle production from the effects of supply chain disruptions earlier in the year.  Factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector also continued to rise, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization moved up.  Revised estimates indicated that households real disposable income declined in the second and third quarters, and the net wealth of households decreased in the third quarter.  Starts and permits for new single family homes in October stayed around the low levels that prevailed since the middle of last year.  Sales of new and existing homes remained slow in recent months, and home prices moved down further.  Inventories in most industries looked to be reasonably well aligned with sales, although motor vehicle stocks continued to be lean.  At the state and local level, real purchases seemed to be decreasing at a slower pace in recent months than earlier in the year.  Consumer prices for energy decreased, and survey data indicated that gasoline prices declined further in November.  Increases in consumer food prices in October were substantially slower than the average pace in the preceding months of this year.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed following the release of the November FOMC statement.  Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities posted mixed changes, on net, over the period and remained at the low end of their recent ranges.  Some European financial institutions reportedly faced significant pressures in unsecured dollar funding markets.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of large United States banking organizations remained volatile over the intermeeting period.  CDS spreads for European banks remained elevated as these institutions faced increasingly strained conditions in short term funding markets.  Market reaction to the announcements by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on November 15 regarding the expansion of the Home Affordable Refinance Program was limited.  M2 expanded at a solid pace in November, likely reflecting increased demand for safe and liquid assets, given concerns over European financial developments.  Spreads of yields on most peripheral euro area countries debt over yields on German debt ended the period higher on net.  China s central bank cut its reserve requirements by 50 basis points, and the central bank of Brazil lowered its policy rate by the same amount.  The upward pressure on consumer prices from the increases in commodity and import prices earlier in the year was expected to continue to subside in the current quarter.  Consumer spending continued to advance, but business fixed investment appeared to be decelerating, and home sales and construction remained at very low levels.  Several participants observed that the ongoing weakness in the housing market came despite low borrowing rates and government initiatives to resolve problems in the foreclosure process.  Reports from business contacts indicated that, in addition to the rise in consumer spending, activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months.  Participants expressed a range of views on the current extent of slack in the labor market.  Participants noted the recent moves by the European authorities to strengthen their commitment to fiscal discipline and to provide greater resources to backstop sovereign debt issuance.  The balance sheets of most United States banks appeared to have improved somewhat, and domestic banks reported increases in commercial lending, even as some European lenders were pulling back.  Several participants commented on strains affecting some community banks, which reportedly had led to tighter credit conditions for their small business clients.  Retail prices of gasoline had declined, and prices of non oil imported goods had softened.  Some participants were concerned that inflation could rise as the recovery continued, and some business contacts had reported that producers expected to see an increase in pricing power over time.  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook had not changed greatly since their previous meeting.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  An accompanying narrative will describe the key factors underlying those assessments as well as qualitative information regarding participants expectations for the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  However, some participants commented that the proposed changes to the swap lines would not by themselves address the need for additional policy action by European authorities.  He shall keep the Federal Open Market Committee informed, and the rates shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee.","id":96},{"text":" Investor concerns about developments in Europe intensified early in the period but subsequently eased a bit amid signs that European authorities were moving toward agreement on a comprehensive framework to address fiscal and financial vulnerabilities and after the Federal Reserve and five other major central banks announced enhanced currency swap arrangements, including lower charges on existing dollar liquidity swap lines.  In dollar funding markets, the spread of the three month London interbank offered rate (Libor) over the overnight index swap (OIS) rate of the same maturity widened noticeably during the intermeeting period.  By contrast, in secured funding markets, spreads on asset backed commercial paper were relatively steady for United States and most European based issuers, and rates on repurchase agreements across various types of collateral were stable.  In the December 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported a moderate tightening of credit terms over the preceding three months on securities financing transactions and over the counter derivatives markets trades, particularly for financial counterparties.  Meanwhile, consumer credit quality improved further in recent months, with delinquency rates on credit card loans declining nearly to historical lows and delinquency rates on nonrevolving credit at commercial banks retreating to pre crisis levels.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since their previous meeting indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate, notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global economic growth.  Other factors that were expected to weigh on the pace of economic activity were the slowdown of economic activity abroad, fiscal tightening in the United States, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, the weak housing market, and household deleveraging.  More broadly, many participants judged that the moderate expansion in economic activity that they were projecting and the associated gradual reduction in the current wide margins of slack in labor and product markets would be consistent with subdued inflation going forward.  In particular, they agreed to continue the program of extending the average maturity of the Federal Reserve s holdings of securities as announced in September, to retain the existing policies regarding the reinvestment of principal payments from Federal Reserve holdings of securities, and to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  For now, however, the Committee agreed to reiterate its anticipation that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid 2013.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Most participants agreed that adding their projections of the target federal funds rate to the economic projections already provided in the SEP would help the public better understand the Committee s monetary policy decisions and the ways in which those decisions depend on members assessments of economic and financial conditions.  It was also noted that the proposed reduction in pricing of the existing swap arrangements could put the cost of dollar borrowing from foreign central banks below the Federal Reserve s primary credit rate and that non U.S. banks might be perceived to have an advantage in meeting their short term funding needs as a result.","id":96},{"text":" Output in the motor vehicle related sectors continued to step up following the disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan earlier in the year, but the pace of factory production outside of those sectors was sluggish.  Moreover, new orders for nondefense capital goods continued to run ahead of shipments in August and September; the buildup of unfilled orders pointed toward further increases in spending for business equipment in subsequent months.  At the state and local level, real purchases declined in the third quarter at a noticeably slower rate than in the first half of the year as the pace of reductions in payrolls eased and construction spending rose slightly.  Measures of near term inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities rose slightly over the intermeeting period, while similar measures of longer term inflation compensation were about unchanged.  For most of the period, market participants seemed heartened by European leaders efforts to address the fiscal and financial challenges present in the euro area, although the news late in the period on a possible Greek referendum sent stock prices down sharply.  However, it was noted that any such accommodation would likely be more effective if it were provided in the context of a future communications initiative, and most of these members agreed that they could support retention of the current policy stance at this meeting.","id":97},{"text":" Foreign economic activity appeared to have largely recovered from the effects of the Japanese disaster in March, as production in Japan rebounded and supply disruptions waned.  The October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices showed less net easing of lending standards by domestic banks than in the past few surveys.","id":97},{"text":" Moreover, many of the factors that have been restraining the recovery, such as the large overhang of vacant houses, tight credit conditions, and elevated risk premiums, remained in place.  In the household sector, incoming data on retail sales were somewhat stronger than expected, and participants reported scattered optimism among their contacts regarding the prospects for holiday spending.  Meeting participants observed that financial markets continued to be particularly volatile during the intermeeting period as investors responded to incoming economic data and to news regarding fiscal and financial developments in Europe.","id":97},{"text":" Measures of labor compensation showed that wage increases continued to be subdued.  However, recent data pointed to considerable weakness in the euro area economy.  Yields on Treasury securities with maturities beyond 10 years moved down.

A number of central banks announced additional measures to stimulate economic activity.","id":97},{"text":" The decrease in exports reflected lower sales of automotive products and capital goods, which more than offset increases in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods.  Overall United States consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was more moderate in the third quarter than in the first half of the year.  Closed end residential mortgage loans held by banks also increased amid the modest pickup in refinancing activity, while CRE loans contracted.  A few participants noted that recent government initiatives aimed at helping high loan to value borrowers refinance could be useful steps toward stabilizing the housing market.","id":97},{"text":" Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to rise further in the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of near term manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, remained at levels consistent with only modest increases in production in the coming months.  In addition, the announcement that the Federal Reserve would lengthen the average maturity of its portfolio by purchasing longer term Treasury securities and selling an equivalent amount of shorter term Treasury securities reportedly contributed to the decline in longer term yields on the day.  Some reversal of safe haven flows in October reportedly led the dollar to give back most of the gains it registered in late September, leaving the broad nominal foreign exchange value of the dollar little changed, on balance, relative to its level at the time of the September FOMC meeting.  However, other important near term indicators of economic activity remained downbeat Measures of consumer sentiment were still very low, business surveys pointed to continued caution by firms, conditions in the labor market remained weak, and gains in manufacturing production outside of the motor vehicle related sectors were sluggish.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of temporary factors that had weighed on the economic recovery in the first half of the year.  The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policies of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion.","id":97},{"text":" Earnings reports for nonfinancial firms generally came in somewhat better than investors expected and about in line with second quarter levels.  In the leveraged loan market, issuance financed by institutional investors slowed significantly in the third quarter.

The staff s forecast for inflation was essentially unchanged from the projection prepared for the September FOMC meeting.","id":97},{"text":" Accordingly, in the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, all Committee members agreed to continue the program of extending the average maturity of the Federal Reserve s holdings of securities as announced in September.

The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":97},{"text":" In secured funding markets, term financing reportedly remained readily available for both domestic and European financial institutions through repurchase agreements backed by Treasury and agency collateral.  Low confidence, continuing efforts to repair balance sheets, and heightened caution in the face of an uncertain economic environment were seen as factors likely to weigh on household spending.  Members noted, however, that the Committee will continue to regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and that it is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.","id":98},{"text":" Since early August, the equity prices of large United States financial institutions fell and their credit default swap (CDS) spreads widened.  The staff s projection for inflation was little changed from its forecast at the time of the August FOMC meeting.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":98},{"text":" Real federal government purchases appeared to increase in recent months as defense expenditures continued to rise from unusually low levels early in the year.  Exports rose briskly in July, particularly in industrial supplies and capital goods, after having decreased in June.  Available measures of labor compensation indicated that wage increases continued to be restrained by the large margin of slack in the labor market.  In addition, retail investors evidently placed redemptions from equity and bond mutual funds into bank deposits and retail money market funds.  Citing concerns over the global economic outlook, the central bank of Brazil reduced its policy rate after having raised it several times earlier this year.  Though mortgage rates were very low, spreads between mortgage rates and yields on Treasury securities were unusually wide.","id":98},{"text":" Output increased markedly at both motor vehicle manufacturers and their upstream suppliers as the supply chain disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan eased.  Prices of money market futures contracts indicated that monetary policy was expected to become more accommodative in both the euro area and the United Kingdom.  A few commented that business contacts reported receiving large numbers of applications for relatively low skilled positions but having difficulty finding and hiring candidates for some highly skilled positions.","id":98},{"text":" Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received during the intermeeting period indicated that economic growth remained slow but did not suggest a contraction in activity.  Participants generally agreed that sluggish job growth and the elevated unemployment rate reflected both weak demand for goods and services and a mismatch between the characteristics of the unemployed and the needs of the employers that currently have jobs available, but they had varying views about the relative importance of these two factors.  One commented that surveys showed that forecasters saw a low likelihood of deflation; a second, however, noted that a measure of the probability of deflation calculated from prices of Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) had declined as the Federal Reserve conducted its second large scale asset purchase program but more recently had been rising.  Several commented that, with households and businesses seeking to reduce leverage rather than to borrow and with housing markets in distress, some of the normal mechanisms through which monetary policy actions are transmitted to the real economy appeared to be attenuated.  Those viewing greater policy accommodation as appropriate at this meeting generally supported a maturity extension program that would combine asset purchases and sales to extend the average maturity of securities held in the SOMA without generating a substantial expansion of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet or reserve balances.  To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee decided to reinvest principal received from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS rather than continuing to reinvest in longer term Treasury securities as had been the Committee s practice for more than a year.  The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and to reinvest principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion.  The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid 2013.","id":98},{"text":" Consumer sentiment deteriorated significantly further in August and stayed downbeat in early September.  In contrast, survey measures of business conditions and sentiment remained at muted levels in August and September.  Meanwhile, spending for drilling and mining structures increased further.  The nominal United States international trade deficit widened in June but narrowed significantly in July.  The consumer price index excluding food and energy rose at about the same average monthly rate in July and August as in the second quarter.  One participant suggested that hurricanes and subsequent flooding had contributed to the slowing in some parts of the country.","id":98},{"text":" In the medium term, the staff still projected real GDP to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further increases in credit availability, and improvements in consumer and business confidence from their current low levels.  They generally judged that risks to the growth outlook, including strains in global financial markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks.  Moreover, still tight credit standards meant that many households were unable to qualify for loans to buy a home, and the drop in house prices in recent years left others unable to refinance an existing higher rate mortgage.  Two members said that current conditions and the outlook could justify stronger policy action, but they supported undertaking the maturity extension program at this meeting as it did not rule out additional steps at future meetings.","id":98},{"text":" Investors initially focused on the firmer forward guidance in the August FOMC statement indicating that the Committee anticipated that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid 2013.  The incoming data on household and business spending were about as expected, on balance, but labor market conditions and indicators of near term economic activity, such as consumer and business sentiment, were weaker than anticipated.  Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that economic activity would increase more rapidly in the second half of this year than over the first half, as supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle sector eased.  The housing sector remained depressed, with construction at very low levels and seen as likely to remain so given the weakness in new home sales and the continuing flow of foreclosed properties into the market.  On the positive side, some participants noted that the reduction in leverage and increase in financial firms liquidity cushions since the height of the financial crisis likely had attenuated the adverse effects of heightened risk aversion.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":98},{"text":" Industrial production expanded solidly but unevenly in July and August, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate moved up.  Starts and permits for new single family homes in July and August stayed near the very low levels seen since the middle of last year.  Output also fell in Japan, reflecting the dislocations caused by the March earthquake.  The expected path of the federal funds rate moved down appreciably over the intermeeting period.","id":98},{"text":" Moreover, the downward revision to first quarter GDP growth and the slow growth reported for the second quarter indicated that the recovery was quite sluggish in the first half of this year.  The staff continued to expect some rebound in economic activity in the near term as the Japan related supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle sector eased.  However, the increase in real GDP was projected to be sufficient to reduce slack in the labor market only slowly, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2012.  Participants also discussed the labor force participation rate, and it was noted that extended unemployment benefits could be increasing the measured unemployment rate by encouraging some workers to remain in the labor force longer than they otherwise would have.","id":99},{"text":" With auto manufacturers expecting supply chain disruptions to ease, motor vehicle assembly schedules called for a substantial step up in production in the third quarter, and initial estimates of production in June were consistent with such a step up.  For the second quarter as a whole, the advance release of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) indicated that real exports of goods and services increased more than real imports, with the result that net exports added significantly to real GDP growth.  In contrast, prices of nonfood, non energy goods were apparently boosted by upward pressure from earlier increases in commodity and import prices, and motor vehicle prices rose further, reflecting the extremely low levels of vehicle inventories.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, United States financial markets were strongly influenced by developments regarding the fiscal situations in the United States and in Europe and by generally weaker than expected readings on economic activity.  Issuance of consumer asset backed securities remained solid in July, although some deals later in the month were reportedly postponed a few days while issuers awaited the outcome of the debt ceiling deliberations.  Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, increased robustly, likely reflecting safe haven flows from riskier assets along with temporary increases in the amount of deposits that money market mutual funds held at their custodian banks.  Stock prices of European banks, which are significant investors in sovereign bonds issued by the peripheral euro area countries, declined appreciably, and some of these banks reportedly faced tighter funding conditions toward the end of the intermeeting period.  Moreover, the lower estimates of real GDP in recent years that were contained in the annual revisions to the NIPA led the staff to lower its estimate of potential GDP growth, both during recent years and over the forecast period, and to mark down further the staff forecast.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth so far this year was considerably slower than they had expected.  Participants judged that temporary factors affecting demand and production, including the damping effect of higher energy and other commodity prices and the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquake, could account for only some of the weakness in economic growth over the first half of the year.  Nonetheless, low consumer confidence, efforts to rebuild balance sheets, and heightened caution on the part of households facing an uncertain economic environment were seen as factors likely to continue to weigh on household spending going forward.  Participants noted that devoting additional time to discussion of the possible costs and benefits of various potential tools would be useful, and they agreed that the September meeting should be extended to two days in order to provide more time.  The Committee agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to state that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid 2013.  That anticipated path for the federal funds rate was viewed both as appropriate in light of most members outlook for the economy and as generally consistent with some prescriptions for monetary policy based on historical and model based analysis.  The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all domestic securities in the System Open Market Account in Treasury securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion.  Temporary factors, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for only some of the recent weakness in economic activity.  The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters than it did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.","id":99},{"text":" Consumer sentiment weakened markedly in July, and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan sentiment index fell to levels last seen in early 2009.  Similarly, sales of new and existing single family homes were subdued in recent months, and home prices continued to trend lower.  Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose only slightly over the past four quarter period, so unit labor costs posted a modest increase.  Following its August meeting, the ECB expanded and extended its offerings of term liquidity and resumed purchases of sovereign debt in the secondary market.  Another participant, however, noted that it could instead reflect a mismatch between the characteristics of the unemployed and the jobs currently available.  Consequently, these participants thought that providing additional stimulus at this time would risk boosting inflation without providing a significant gain in output or employment.  Household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply chain disruptions.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.","id":99},{"text":" Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate moved down further through July.  The manufacturing capacity utilization rate held about flat in recent months.  Real consumer spending was nearly unchanged in the second quarter.  Consumer spending on goods and services other than motor vehicles also appeared soft through June.  Foreign economic growth appeared to have slowed significantly in recent months.  Mortgage refinancing activity picked up but remained relatively subdued.  Delinquency rates for most types of consumer loans moved down in recent months.  No such references were included in the statement for this meeting.","id":99},{"text":" Labor earnings rose in the second quarter, but increases in consumer prices offset much of the gain in nominal income.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was solid in July, although below the elevated pace posted in the second quarter.  Total consumer credit expanded at a moderate rate in May as both nonrevolving and revolving credit posted gains.  Central banks in several emerging market economies, including China, continued to tighten policy in response to inflationary pressures.  The weakness in household and business spending was accompanied by fiscal consolidation at the state and local level.  A few participants noted that a reduction in the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances could also be helpful in easing financial conditions.","id":99},{"text":" Upward pressures on core consumer prices appeared to reflect the elevated prices of commodities and other imports, along with notable increases in motor vehicle prices likely arising from the effects of recent supply chain disruptions and the resulting extremely low level of automobile inventories.  Participants noted several transitory factors that were restraining growth, including the global supply chain disruptions in the wake of the Japanese earthquake, the unusually severe weather in some parts of the United States, a drop in defense spending, and the effects of increases in oil and other commodity prices this year on household purchasing power and spending.  In identifying possible risks to financial stability, a few participants expressed concern that credit conditions in some sectors most notably the agriculture sector might have eased too much amid signs that investors in these markets were aggressively taking on more leverage and risk in order to obtain higher returns.  At same time, extremely low motor vehicle inventories resulting from global supply disruptions in the wake of the Japanese earthquake by contributing to higher motor vehicle prices had significantly raised inflation, although participants anticipated that these temporary pressures would lessen as motor vehicle inventories were rebuilt.  Committee Policy Action In the discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that the Committee should complete its $600 billion asset purchase program at the end of the month and that no changes to the target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting.  The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan.","id":100},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the June 21 22 meeting indicated that the pace of the economic recovery slowed in recent months and that conditions in the labor market had softened.  The expansion of private nonfarm payroll employment in May was markedly below the average pace of job gains in the previous months of this year.  However, motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to rise notably in the third quarter from their levels in recent months, as bottlenecks in parts supplies were anticipated to ease.  The available indicators suggested that real business investment in equipment and software was rising a bit more slowly in the second quarter than the solid pace seen in the first quarter.  Real nonfarm inventory investment rose moderately in the first quarter, but data for April suggested that the pace of inventory accumulation had slowed.  The available data on government spending indicated that real federal purchases increased in recent months, led by a rebound in outlays for defense in April and May from unusually low levels in the first quarter.  Available measures of labor compensation showed that labor cost pressures were still subdued, as wage increases continued to be restrained by the large amount of slack in the labor market.  The Japanese economy contracted sharply following the earthquake in March, and the associated supply chain disruptions weighed on the economies of many of Japan s trading partners.  Dealers also reported that the demand for funding had increased over the same period for a broad range of securities, with the exception of equities.  Delinquency rates for consumer debt edged down further in recent months, with delinquency rates on some categories moving back to pre crisis levels.  Headline equity indexes abroad and foreign benchmark sovereign yields declined over the intermeeting period in apparent response to signs of a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity and reduced demand for risky assets.  In the advanced foreign economies, most central banks left their policy rates unchanged, and the anticipated pace of monetary policy tightening indicated by money market futures quotes was pared back.  Nonetheless, most participants judged that the pace of the economic recovery was likely to be somewhat slower over coming quarters than they had projected in April.  These participants noted that labor costs were rising only slowly, and that persistent slack in labor and product markets would likely limit upward pressures on prices in coming quarters.  The information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the economic recovery was continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected, and that the labor market was weaker than anticipated.  The Committee directs the Desk to complete purchases of $600 billion of longer term Treasury securities by the end of this month.","id":100},{"text":" Total industrial production expanded only a bit during April and May after rising at a solid pace in the first quarter.  Recent declines in the prices of oil and other commodities contributed to some easing of inflationary pressures abroad.  Rates on conforming fixed rate residential mortgages declined about in line with 10 year Treasury yields over the intermeeting period.  The Federal Reserve continued its competitive sales of non agency residential mortgage backed securities held by Maiden Lane II LLC over the intermeeting period.  However, central banks in several emerging market economies continued to tighten policy, and the monetary authorities in China increased required reserve ratios further.  A few participants expressed uncertainty about the efficacy of monetary policy in current circumstances but disagreed on the implications for future policy.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.","id":100},{"text":" Shortages of specialized components imported from Japan contributed to a decline in the output of motor vehicles and parts.  In addition, consumer sentiment stayed relatively low through early June.  Outstanding residential mortgage debt contracted further in the first quarter.  In contrast, C I loans increased at a brisk pace in April and May.  Bankers again reported gradual improvements in credit quality and generally weak loan demand.  Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated.","id":100},{"text":" Forward looking indicators of industrial activity, such as the new orders diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, weakened noticeably during the intermeeting period to levels consistent with only tepid gains in factory output in coming months.  Stock prices of financial firms underperformed the broader market, reflecting the weaker economic outlook, potential credit rating downgrades, and heightened concerns about the anticipated capital surcharge for systemically important financial institutions.  Although the initial offerings of these securities were well received, investor demand at the most recent sales was not as strong, a development consistent with the declines in the prices of non agency residential mortgage backed securities over the intermeeting period.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the economic information received during the intermeeting period indicated that the economic recovery was continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than they had anticipated at the time of the April meeting.","id":100},{"text":" Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods declined in April.  Survey measures of business conditions and sentiment weakened during the intermeeting period.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was strong in April and May.  Issuance of consumer asset backed securities remained robust over the intermeeting period.  Activity in the business sector appeared to have slowed somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Participants noted several factors that had contributed to the increase in inflation this year.  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand.","id":100},{"text":" Total real personal consumption expenditures picked up in February after being about unchanged in January.  In addition, consumer sentiment declined noticeably in March and remained relatively downbeat in early April.  Excluding food and energy, core consumer price inflation remained relatively subdued.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations remained robust in March.  Mortgage refinancing activity remained near its lowest level in more than two years.  Issuance of consumer asset backed securities remained steady in the first quarter of the year.  Activity in the industrial sector also expanded further.  Financial market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period.  Consumer credit conditions also eased somewhat from the tight conditions seen during the recession.  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand.","id":101},{"text":" The rise in consumer spending appeared to have slowed to a moderate rate in the first quarter from the stronger pace posted in the fourth quarter of last year.  Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, advanced at a solid pace likely reflecting very low opportunity costs of holding such deposits.  Participants continued to project the unemployment rate to decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain elevated compared with their assessments of its longer run level.  Banks reported an easing of lending terms on C I loans, usually prompted by increased competition in the face of still weak loan demand.  These commodity price increases, in turn, reflected robust global demand and geopolitical developments that had reduced supply.  While rising energy prices posed an upside risk to the inflation forecast, they also posed a downside risk to economic growth.  The Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in longer term Treasury securities.","id":101},{"text":" Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at motor vehicles and parts outlets, posted a sizable gain in March, but sales of new light motor vehicles declined somewhat.  Available measures of labor compensation suggested that wage increases continued to be restrained by the presence of a large margin of slack in the labor market.  Industrial production posted solid gains, and, while the most recent readings from some of the regional manufacturing surveys showed small declines, in some cases these were from near record highs.","id":101},{"text":" Real disposable income edged down in February following an increase in January that reflected the temporary reduction in payroll taxes.  Activity in the housing market remained very weak, as the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties continued to restrain new construction.  The available data on government spending indicated that real federal purchases fell in the first quarter, led by a reduction in defense outlays.  Near term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained elevated in early April.  Average hourly earnings for all employees were flat in March, and their average rate of increase over the preceding 12 months remained low.  The pace of recovery abroad appeared to have strengthened earlier this year, but the disaster in Japan raised uncertainties about foreign activity in the near term.","id":101},{"text":" More recently, survey data through the middle of April pointed to additional increases in retail gasoline prices, while increases in the prices of food commodities appeared to have moderated somewhat.  Short term funding rates, including the effective federal funds rate, shifted down several basis points in early April following a change in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s deposit insurance assessment system.  The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada left their policy rates unchanged, but quotes from futures markets continued to suggest that both central banks would raise rates later this year.  The broad nominal index of the United States dollar declined more than 2 percent over the intermeeting period, though the dollar appreciated, on net, against the Japanese yen.  Recent increases in consumer food and energy prices, together with the small uptick in core consumer price inflation, led the staff to raise its near term projection for consumer price inflation.  Growth in consumer spending remained moderate despite the effects of higher gasoline and food prices, which appeared to have largely offset the increase in disposable income from the payroll tax cut.  While some measures of longer term inflation expectations had risen, others were little changed or down, on net, since March, and members agreed that longer term inflation expectations had remained stable.","id":101},{"text":" Participants revised up their projections for total inflation in 2011, reflecting recent increases in energy and other commodity prices, but they generally anticipated that the recent increase in inflation would be transitory as commodity prices stabilize and inflation expectations remain anchored.  They acknowledged, however, that sentiment can change quickly; indeed, one participant noted that his contacts had recently turned more pessimistic, and several participants indicated that their business contacts expressed concern about the effects of higher commodity prices on their own costs and on the purchasing power of households.  A few participants expressed concern that the easing of credit conditions was creating incentives for increased leverage and risk taking in some areas, such as leveraged syndicated loans and loans to finance land acquisition, and that this trend, if it became widespread and excessive, could pose a risk to financial stability.  A few of these participants thought that economic conditions might warrant action to raise the federal funds rate target or to sell assets in the SOMA portfolio later this year, but noted that even with such steps, monetary policy would remain accommodative for some time to come.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":101},{"text":" In contrast, business outlays for nonresidential construction remained extremely weak in February, restrained by high vacancy rates, low prices for office and commercial properties, and tight credit conditions for commercial real estate lending.  The European Central Bank raised its main policy rate 25 basis points to 1 1/4 percent during the intermeeting period, and markets appeared to have priced in additional rate increases over the rest of the year.  In contrast, the housing sector remained distressed, with house prices flat to down and a large overhang of vacant properties restraining new construction, although reports indicated that sales volumes and traffic were higher in a few areas.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":101},{"text":" Total industrial production was little changed in January after a strong rise in December.  Measures of house prices softened again in December and January.  Consumer credit markets showed further signs of improvement.  Bankers again reported improving credit quality and generally weak loan demand.  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand.","id":102},{"text":" Manufacturing output posted a relatively subdued gain in January, likely held down somewhat by the extensive snowfalls during that month; in addition, a scheduled step up in assemblies of motor vehicles reportedly was restrained in part by some temporary bottlenecks in the supply chain.  Outside of motor vehicles, the rise in the book value of business inventories was somewhat larger in January than the average monthly increase in the fourth quarter, while inventory to sales ratios for most industries covered by these data were similar to their pre recession norms.  The price index for PCE excluding food and energy (the core PCE price index) rose slightly in January, boosted by an uptick in prices of core goods after four months of declines; the 12 month change in this core price index stayed near the very low levels seen in late 2010.  According to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, households near term inflation expectations increased substantially in early March, likely because of the run up in gasoline prices; longer term inflation expectations moved up somewhat in the early March survey but were still within the range that prevailed over the preceding few years.  Changes to the conditioning assumptions underlying the staff projection were mostly small and offsetting Crude oil prices had risen sharply and federal fiscal policy seemed likely to be marginally more restrictive than the staff had judged in January, but these negative factors were counterbalanced by higher household net worth and a slightly lower foreign exchange value of the dollar.  However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In discussing intermeeting developments and their implications for the economic outlook, participants agreed that the information received since their previous meeting was broadly consistent with their expectations and suggested that the economic recovery was on a firmer footing.  Participants generally judged that there was still substantial slack in the labor market, though estimates of the degree of slack were admittedly imprecise and depended in part on judgments about a number of factors, including the extent to which labor force participation would increase as the recovery progresses and employment expands.","id":102},{"text":" Moreover, motor vehicle assemblies picked up in February and were scheduled to rise further through the second quarter of this year.  In January, starts and permits for new single family homes remained near the low levels that had prevailed since the middle of 2010.  Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have picked up in early 2011 after slowing markedly in the fourth quarter.  In the motor vehicles sector, inventories rose slightly, on net, in January and February after having been drawn down in the fourth quarter.  On net, expectations for the federal funds rate, along with yields on nominal Treasury securities, were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was relatively subdued in January and February.  Rates of serious delinquency for subprime and prime mortgages were little changed in December and January.  The issuance of consumer asset backed securities, which had weakened around the turn of the year, posted a moderate gain in February.  The staff revised up its projection for consumer price inflation in the near term, largely because of the recent increases in the prices of energy and food.  Looking through weather related distortions in various indicators, measures of consumer spending, business investment, and employment showed continued expansion.  Moreover, a number of participants expected that slack in resource utilization would continue to restrain increases in labor costs and prices.  On the one hand, labor market conditions were improving, though gradually, and the temporary cut in payroll taxes was contributing to rising after tax incomes.  Business contacts in a variety of industries had expressed concern that consumers might pull back if gasoline prices rose significantly further and persisted at those elevated levels.  In contrast to headline inflation, core inflation and other measures of underlying inflation remained subdued, though they appeared to have bottomed out.  Several also noted the possibility of larger than anticipated near term cuts in federal government spending.  Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run.","id":102},{"text":" At the state and local level, ongoing fiscal pressures were reflected in further job cuts in January and February.  Dealers noted that the demand for funding had increased for a broad range of securities over the same period.  In addition, although residential construction remained weak, investment in energy extraction was growing and spending on commercial construction projects appeared to be bottoming out.","id":102},{"text":" Delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools and on auto loans at finance companies continued to decline through January, nearly returning to their longer run averages.  However, the outlook for economic activity over the medium term was broadly similar to the projection prepared for the January FOMC meeting.  A few members noted that evidence of a stronger recovery, or of higher inflation or rising inflation expectations, could make it appropriate to reduce the pace or overall size of the purchase program.","id":102},{"text":" In the United Kingdom, market based readings on expected policy rates indicated that investors anticipated some tightening of policy before the end of this year.  Indeed, bank and nonbank lenders reported that terms and conditions for auto loans had returned to historical norms.  Nonetheless, longer term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued.","id":102},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the March 15 meeting indicated that the economic recovery continued to proceed at a moderate pace, with a further gradual improvement in labor market conditions.  The upbeat tenor of the incoming data for the emerging market economies suggested that the economic expansion in these countries continued to outpace that in the advanced economies.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds edged down relative to those on comparable maturity Treasury securities.  Option implied volatility on the S P 500 index rose sharply in mid February in response to events in the MENA region and remained somewhat elevated thereafter.  Participants noted that recent increases in the prices of oil and other commodities were putting upward pressure on headline inflation, but that measures of underlying inflation remained subdued.  They anticipated that the effects on inflation of the recent run up in commodity prices would prove transitory, in part because they saw longer term inflation expectations remaining stable.  Participants noted regional differences in the speed of improvement in labor markets; scattered reports indicated that firms in some regions were having difficulty hiring some types of highly skilled workers.  A number of participants noted that, with significant slack in resource utilization and with longer term inflation expectations stable, underlying inflation likely would remain subdued for some time.  The information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the economic recovery was on a firmer footing and that overall conditions in the labor market were gradually improving.","id":102},{"text":" Private nonfarm payroll employment rose noticeably in February after a small increase in January, with the swing in hiring likely magnified by widespread snow storms, which may have held down the employment figure for January.  In February, indicators of near term industrial production, such as the new orders diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels consistent with solid increases in factory output in the coming months.  Overall consumer prices in the United States rose somewhat faster in December and January than in earlier months, as consumer energy prices posted further sizable increases and consumer food prices responded to the recent upturn in farm commodity prices.  Labor cost pressures remained muted in the fourth quarter, as hourly compensation continued to be restrained by the wide margin of slack in the labor market and as productivity rose further.  Over the weeks following the FOMC meeting, nominal Treasury yields and the expected path of the federal funds rate in coming quarters moved higher, as market participants apparently read the incoming economic data as, on balance, somewhat better than expected.  In addition, participants noted that unfolding events in the Middle East and North Africa, along with the recent earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent developments in Japan, had further increased uncertainty about the economic outlook.  On the upside, the improvement in labor market conditions in recent months raised the possibility that household spending and subsequently business investment might expand more rapidly than anticipated; if so, the recovery could be stronger than currently projected.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that no changes to the Committee s asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":102},{"text":" The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.

Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on December 14, 2010.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Structural Unemployment A staff presentation on structural unemployment summarized a broad range of economic research on the topic conducted across the Federal Reserve System.  Several participants noted that estimates of the contributions of the individual factors depended importantly on the approach taken by researchers, including the models used and the assumptions made.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 25 26 meeting indicated that the economic recovery was firming, though the expansion had not yet been sufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions.  Consumer spending rose strongly late last year, and the ongoing expansion in business outlays for equipment and software appeared to have been sustained in recent months.  Although motor vehicle assemblies dropped back in those months, production in the manufacturing sector outside of motor vehicles posted solid gains that were fairly widespread across industries; as a result, capacity utilization in manufacturing increased further, although it remained below its long run average.  Most indicators of near term industrial activity, such as the new orders diffusion indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels consistent with further increases in industrial production in the near term; in addition, motor vehicle production was scheduled to move up again in early 2011.  Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases of motor vehicles and parts, rose again in December, following substantial increases in the previous four months.  Consumer credit started to increase again in October and November after having generally declined since the fall of 2008.  Starts and permits for new single family homes in November and December were still near the very low levels recorded since midyear.  Moreover, measures of house prices declined further in recent months, and survey responses indicated that households remained concerned that home values might continue to fall.  Real business investment in equipment and software appeared to have increased further in the fourth quarter, although likely at a more moderate rate than in the first three quarters of 2010.  Available indicators suggested that business purchases of software stayed on a solid uptrend, and outlays for computing and communications equipment appeared to have risen briskly.  However, business spending for transportation equipment, including aircraft and motor vehicles, likely declined in the fourth quarter of 2010 after expanding rapidly earlier in the year.  Business outlays for nonresidential structures stayed weak, reflecting high vacancy rates and low property values for office and commercial properties, as well as tight credit conditions for commercial real estate.  Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have slowed substantially in the fourth quarter after a sizable increase in the previous quarter.  Much of the fourth quarter downswing was likely associated with a drawdown of motor vehicle stocks after an accumulation in the third quarter.  Book value data for October and November suggested that the pace of inventory accumulation also was slowing outside of the motor vehicle sector.  The 12 month change in the core CPI remained near the very low readings of the previous two months.  The 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees continued to be low in December.  The increase in exports was driven by agricultural goods, in part reflecting higher prices, as well as by consumer goods.  The rise in imports reflected an increase in the value of imported petroleum products, mostly explained by higher prices, and of capital goods, which was supported importantly by a jump in computers.  Much of this strength was centered in the emerging market economies (EMEs), where widespread increases in exports and in manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to a resurgence in economic growth following a slowdown in the third quarter of 2010.  Foreign inflation picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter of 2010, mostly because of an acceleration of energy and food prices.  Some EMEs reportedly took steps to limit the appreciation of their currencies by intervening in foreign exchange markets, and some acted to discourage capital inflows.  Futures quotes indicated that the expected path for the federal funds rate did not change appreciably over the intermeeting period.  The purchases of longer term Treasury securities by the Desk during the intermeeting period reportedly had no significant effects on measures of day to day Treasury market functioning.  Inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) moved up, likely pushed higher by rising prices for oil and other commodities and by the firming of the economic outlook.  Spreads of dollar London interbank offered rates, or Libor, over overnight index swap rates held fairly steady across the term structure, as the year end passed without incident.  Anecdotal reports suggested that the modestly rising trend in the use of dealer intermediated leverage evident in 2010 had continued into 2011, but information from a variety of sources indicated that leverage remained well below the levels reached before the crisis.  The increase in equity prices reflected the apparent firming of the economic recovery and favorable early reports on fourth quarter corporate earnings.  Refinancing activity, which had fallen in response to the increase in mortgage rates in November, remained at a low level during the period.  Outstanding residential mortgage debt declined further in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting weak housing activity and tight lending standards.  Serious delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages flattened out in October and November after having moved down earlier in the year.  Signs of improvement were evident in the consumer credit market, where issuance of consumer asset backed securities was strong early in the fourth quarter.  Despite continued weakness in many residential real estate indicators, closed end residential mortgage loans held by large banks rose noticeably for the fifth consecutive month in December.  The behavior of the components of core loans in recent months was broadly consistent with the results of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in January.  Meanwhile, moderate net fractions of respondents indicated that demand for C I loans had strengthened over the preceding three months, and that inquiries from business borrowers for new or increased credit lines had picked up.  The ongoing compositional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely reflected the relatively high yields on liquid deposits compared with yields on many other components of M2.  The broad nominal index of the United States dollar declined more than 1 percent over the intermeeting period, depreciating by roughly similar amounts, on average, against the currencies of the AFEs and the EMEs.  Greek, Irish, and Portuguese sovereign debt spreads over German bunds rose in December and early January as credit rating agencies downgraded the sovereign debt of Ireland and Portugal.  The staff anticipated that brisk increases in energy prices would raise total consumer price inflation above core inflation this year, but that upward pressure from energy prices would wane by next year.  Spending by households picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter, business outlays continued to grow at a moderate pace, and conditions in labor and financial markets improved somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Although business contacts remained somewhat cautious about the economic outlook, they generally indicated greater optimism regarding their own prospects for sales and hiring than at the time of the previous meeting.  On the one hand, the additional spending could reflect pent up demand following the downturn or greater confidence on the part of households about the future, in which case it might be expected to continue.  Industrial production posted solid gains, supported in part by United States exports that appeared to have been noticeably stronger in the fourth quarter.  A wide range of business contacts expressed cautious optimism about the durability and strength of the recovery, and some were planning for an expansion in production in order to meet an anticipated rise in sales.  In addition, although residential construction spending remained weak, spending on commercial construction projects showed some tentative signs of bottoming out.  Some businesses remained reluctant to add permanent positions and were planning to meet their labor requirements with temporary workers.  Overall, meeting participants continued to express disappointment in both the pace and the unevenness of the improvements in labor markets and noted that they would monitor labor market developments closely.  Market based measures of inflation compensation over the next few years increased further over the intermeeting period, extending the rise that occurred over recent months.  Some participants suggested that the increase likely reflected, in part, a decline in investors perceptions of the near term risk of further disinflation.  Some participants noted that, taken together, these financial developments were consistent with a more accommodative stance of monetary policy since last summer or a reduction in risk aversion on the part of market participants.  Some participants indicated that while unit labor costs generally had declined and profit margins were wide, the higher commodity prices were boosting costs of production for many firms.  Some participants noted that incoming data on production, spending, and employment would need to be solid for a while longer to justify a significant upward revision to their outlook for the likely pace of the recovery.  On the upside, the recent strength in household spending raised the possibility that domestic final demand could snap back more rapidly than anticipated.  Some participants expressed concern that in a situation in which businesses had been unable to raise prices in response to higher costs for some time, firms might increase them substantially once they found themselves with sufficient pricing power.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that no changes to the Committee s asset purchase program or to its target range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting.  The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and reaffirmed its intention to purchase $600 billion of longer term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.  A few members remained unsure of the likely effects of the asset purchase program on the economy, but felt that making changes to the program at this time was not appropriate.  A few members noted that additional data pointing to a sufficiently strong recovery could make it appropriate to consider reducing the pace or overall size of the purchase program.  In addition, the Committee reiterated its expectation that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee also directs the Desk to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in longer term Treasury securities.  Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow.  In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and intends to purchase $600 billion of longer term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.","id":103},{"text":" 3.  4.  3.  4.  3.  4.  3.","id":103},{"text":" Purchases of existing homes edged lower in October; in part, the still low level of sales likely reflected the payback from the earlier surge in sales associated with the homebuyer tax credit and also the moratoriums on sales of bank owned properties.  Measures of house prices declined recently, and households concerns that home values might continue to fall, their pessimism about the outlook for employment and income, and the tight standards faced by many mortgage borrowers appeared to be weighing on demand.  The spread of the three month London interbank offered rate (or Libor) forward rate agreement over the three month forward overnight index swap (OIS) rate moved a bit higher, on balance, perhaps pointing to heightened concerns about future funding conditions.  The announcement of the European Union (EU) International Monetary Fund (IMF) financial aid package for Ireland on November 28 did little to reverse the depreciation of the euro, as investors reportedly became increasingly concerned about other euro area economies and the adequacy of resources available to support them should they come under stress.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the information received during the intermeeting period as pointing to some improvement in the near term outlook, and they expected that economic growth, which had been moderate, would pick up somewhat going forward.  The Committee also decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reiterate its expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":104},{"text":" In contrast, Spanish economic activity stagnated in the third quarter, Greek GDP extended its decline, and more recent indicators point to continued weakness in peripheral European economies.  In the December 2010 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, dealers reported an easing of credit terms over the preceding three months with respect to securities financing transactions and across a range of counterparties.  Interest rates available on all M2 assets remained very low, and households continued to shift their holdings of M2 assets toward liquid deposits, which continued to rise rapidly, and away from small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds.  The staff forecast incorporated the assumption that new fiscal actions, some of which had not been anticipated in its previous forecast, were likely to boost the level of real GDP in 2011 and 2012.","id":104},{"text":" It was noted that the backup in rates may have been amplified by year end positioning, as well as by some reported mortgage related hedging flows.  A few mentioned the possibility that growth could pick up more rapidly than expected, particularly in light of the very accommodative stance of monetary policy currently in place.  Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak.","id":104},{"text":" Motor vehicle assemblies, which rose in October, fell back in November but were scheduled to move up again in coming months.  In October, starts of new single family homes remained at the very low level that had prevailed since August.  Real business investment in equipment and software appeared to be increasing, although the pace of spending seemed to have moderated from the rapid rate of the first half of the year.  In contrast, consumer energy prices continued to rise rapidly in October, and spot prices of imported crude oil moved higher, on net, during November and early December.  Futures quotes suggested that the path for the federal funds rate expected by market participants rose over the intermeeting period.  Some signs of modest stress emerged in certain short term funding markets over the intermeeting period as investors focused increasingly on the evolving situation in Europe.  According to the latest Call Report data, bank profitability was little changed in the third quarter, remaining positive but well below pre crisis levels.  Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined.  One common concern was that the housing sector could weaken further in light of the considerable supply of houses either on the market or likely to come to market.","id":104},{"text":" Employment at state and local governments rose slightly over the two month period.  Available measures of labor compensation showed that labor cost pressures were still restrained.  The 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees remained low in November.  Stock prices for domestic commercial banks were volatile but outperformed broad indexes on balance.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms through seasoned and initial public offerings was particularly strong in November.  Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to improve.  Issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities increased in November but was still far below pre crisis levels.  Commercial bank credit was about flat, on average, during October and November.  Currency increased strongly, with indicators suggesting robust demand from abroad.  Participants noted, however, that the European authorities were taking steps to stabilize conditions in the euro area.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":104},{"text":" New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, continued to outpace shipments through September.

Credit conditions improved further in the third quarter, particularly for larger firms with access to the capital markets.  Real GDP growth apparently moderated in the advanced foreign economies as well.  However, closed end residential mortgage loans on banks books increased modestly for the second month in a row.  Participants observed that firms had generated rising profits, but that business contacts indicated those gains largely reflected cost cutting rather than top line growth in revenues.  Moreover, members generally thought that progress was likely to remain slow.","id":105},{"text":" Moreover, despite further declines in mortgage interest rates in recent months, other factors continued to restrain housing demand, including consumer pessimism about the outlook for jobs and income, the depressed rate of household formation, and tight underwriting standards for mortgages.  At earlier stages of processing, the rise in producer prices for intermediate materials remained moderate in September, but prices of globally traded industrial and agricultural commodities accelerated considerably in October, reflecting in part the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar as well as concerns about supply for certain commodities.  Anecdotal reports pointed to the increased likelihood of additional asset purchases by the Federal Reserve and to FOMC communications noting that the Committee viewed underlying inflation as somewhat below the levels judged to be most consistent with the Committee s dual mandate as factors contributing to lower yields and to the increase in inflation compensation over the period.  Staff Economic Outlook Because the recent data on production and spending were broadly in line with the staff s expectations, the forecast for economic activity that was prepared for the November FOMC meeting showed little change to the staff s near term outlook relative to the forecast prepared for the September FOMC meeting.  Many participants saw evidence that the current unemployment rate was well above levels that could be explained by structural factors alone, noting, for example, reports from business contacts indicating that weak growth in demand for their firms products remained a key reason why they were reluctant to add employees, and job vacancy rates that were low relative to historical experience.  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period immediately ahead, nearly all Committee members agreed to keep the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound by maintaining the target range for that rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to expand the Federal Reserve s holdings of longer term securities.  To increase its securities holdings, the Committee decided to continue its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings into longer term Treasury securities and intended to purchase a further $600 billion of longer term Treasury securities at a pace of about $75 billion per month through the second quarter of 2011.","id":105},{"text":" The compositional shift likely reflected the relatively attractive yields on liquid deposits.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally agreed that the incoming data indicated that output and employment were continuing to increase, but only slowly.  Although participants considered it quite unlikely that the economy would slide back into recession, some noted that continued slow growth and high levels of resource slack could leave the economic expansion vulnerable to negative shocks.  Most longer term nominal interest rates declined, real interest rates fell even more, credit spreads tightened, and equity prices rose, in part reflecting better than expected corporate earnings reports.","id":105},{"text":" Production of motor vehicles picked up during the third quarter as automakers replenished dealers stocks, but motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to drop back in coming months.  Business investment in nonresidential structures was about flat in the third quarter as another strong increase in spending for drilling and mining structures offset further declines in outlays on commercial and industrial buildings.  With respect to business spending, contacts generally reported that they were investing to reduce costs but were refraining from adding workers or expanding capacity in the United States.  Committee Policy Action Though the economic recovery was continuing, members considered progress toward meeting the Committee s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability as having been disappointingly slow.  Nearly all members agreed that the statement should reiterate the expectation that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":105},{"text":" Data for retail sales and the sales of light motor vehicles pointed to a moderate gain in real consumer spending in August.  Sales of existing homes fell substantially in July, and the index of pending home sales suggested that sales were muted in August.  The interest rate for 30 year fixed rate conforming mortgages remained essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period at a historically low level.  In Canada and Japan, the rise in real GDP slowed noticeably in the second quarter.  The expected path of the federal funds rate moved down early in the intermeeting period in response to weaker than expected economic data.  Conditions in short term funding markets continued to improve following the recent stresses related to concerns about financial stability in Europe.  However, businesses also indicated that concerns about actual and anticipated demand were important factors limiting investment and hiring.","id":106},{"text":" After falling back in July, consumer confidence remained downbeat in August and early September, with households more pessimistic about the outlook for their personal financial situations and general economic conditions.  Starts of new single family houses in July and August were below the low level seen in June, and the number of new permits issued in August appeared to signal that little improvement in new homebuilding was likely in September.  In the second quarter, businesses appeared to build their inventories at a faster pace than earlier in the year, but ratios of inventories to sales for most industries did not point to any sizable overhangs.  The expected path of the federal funds rate rose for a time following the more positive than expected data on manufacturing activity and the labor market released in early September, but the path ended the intermeeting period down on balance.  For households, record low mortgage rates supported a relatively high level of refinancing activity, but many borrowers reportedly remained unable to refinance because of insufficient home equity or poor credit histories.  The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of growth next year but continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.  Although prices of some commodities and imported goods had risen recently, many business contacts reported that they currently had little pricing power and that they anticipated limited, if any, increases in labor costs.","id":106},{"text":" At earlier stages of production, producer prices of core intermediate materials moved down, on net, during July and August while most indexes of spot commodity prices increased.  Unit labor costs at the end of the second quarter remained below their level one year earlier, as labor compensation continued to increase only slowly and labor productivity stayed near its recent high level.  The European Central Bank (ECB) said that it would continue to provide term liquidity by offering several more full allotment three month refinancing operations through the end of the year.  Nearly all members agreed that the statement should reiterate the expectation that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":106},{"text":" Nonetheless, the volume of CMBS issuance in 2010 remained quite low compared with the levels seen before the onset of the financial crisis, and total commercial mortgage debt continued to contract amid further increases in delinquency rates on commercial mortgages.  Although many members considered the recent and anticipated progress toward meeting the Committee s mandate of maximum employment and price stability to be unsatisfactory, members observed that incoming data over the intermeeting period indicated that the economic recovery was continuing, albeit slowly.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain the total face value of domestic securities held in the System Open Market Account at approximately $2 trillion by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in longer term Treasury securities.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.","id":106},{"text":" Private businesses increased employment modestly in August, but the length of the workweek was unchanged and the unemployment rate remained elevated.

Consumer spending continued to increase at a moderate rate in July and appeared to move up again in August.  The labor force participation rate moved up a little in August but was still low.  Industrial production increased solidly in July and then rose more moderately in August.  However, the production of motor vehicles was pared back in August.  Consumer credit declined in the second quarter and appeared to contract further in July.  Businesses reported continued strong foreign demand for their products, particularly from Asia.  Bank lending has continued to contract, but at a reduced rate in recent months.","id":106},{"text":" Over the intermeeting period, investors appeared to mark down the path for monetary policy in response to weaker than expected economic data releases and Federal Reserve communications that were read as suggesting that policymakers concerns about the economic outlook had increased.  In secured funding markets, spreads on asset backed commercial paper moved down, while rates and haircuts on collateral for repurchase agreements involving Treasury and agency collateral held steady.  In foreign exchange markets, the value of the dollar declined on balance over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting some reversal of flight to safety flows, better than expected European economic data, and the softer economic outlook for the United States.  The release of the results of the European Union stress test exercise, including data on European banks exposures to sovereign debt, appeared to ease concerns about the potential for severe financial dislocations in Europe.  Over the forecast period, the increase in real GDP was projected to be sufficient to slowly reduce economic slack, although resource slack was still anticipated to remain quite elevated at the end of 2011.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants generally characterized the economic information received during the intermeeting period as indicating a slowing in the pace of recovery in output and employment in recent months.  Many participants noted that the protracted downturn in house prices and in residential investment seemed to have ended, although ups and downs in housing starts and home sales associated with the temporary tax credit for homebuyers made it difficult to be certain.  Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee s dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.  Against this backdrop, the Committee discussed the implications for financial conditions and the economic outlook of continuing its policy of not reinvesting principal repayments received on MBS or maturing agency debt.  Most members judged, in light of current conditions in the MBS market and the Committee s desire to normalize the composition of the Federal Reserve s portfolio, that it would be better to reinvest in longer term Treasury securities than in MBS.  All but one member concluded that it would be appropriate to begin reinvesting principal received from agency debt and MBS held in the SOMA by purchasing longer term Treasury securities in order to keep constant the face value of securities held in the SOMA and thus avoid the upward pressure on longer term interest rates that might result if those holdings were allowed to decline.  All members but one judged that it was appropriate to reiterate the expectation that economic conditions including low levels of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 15 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months.","id":107},{"text":" Private employment increased slowly in June and July, and industrial production was little changed in June after a large increase in May.  The drop in manufacturing output included a reduction in motor vehicle assemblies, but they were scheduled to increase noticeably in July.  The June decrease in factory output also reflected weaker production in industries producing non automotive consumer goods and construction and business supplies.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing in June stood well above its mid 2009 low, but it was still substantially short of its longer run average.  Sales of light motor vehicles continued to move up, on balance, with the level of sales in July slightly higher than the second quarter average.  The housing market, which had been supported earlier in the year by activity associated with the homebuyer tax credits, was quite soft for a second consecutive month in June.  The interest rate on 30 year fixed rate conforming mortgages fell further during July, reaching a record low for the 39 year history of the series.  Survey indicators of business conditions and sentiment softened in July but remained consistent with further gains in production and capital spending in the near term.  Business investment in nonresidential structures turned up in the second quarter, with spending boosted by the rise in outlays for drilling and mining structures.  At the same time, the core PCE price index moved up only slightly, and the year over year increase in the index in June was lower than earlier in the year.  Recent indicators of economic activity for the euro area showed little imprint of the fiscal stresses that emerged in the spring.  In contrast, Mexican indicators suggested that economic activity rebounded in the second quarter after contracting in the first quarter.  Gross bond issuance by United States investment grade nonfinancial corporations rebounded in July from relatively subdued levels in May and June.  The softer tone of incoming economic data suggested that the pace of the expansion would be slower over the near term than previously projected.  Revised national income and product account data showed that the contraction in aggregate output during the recent recession had been larger than previously reported.  Other participants cited business surveys and reports from business contacts indicating that slow growth in sales and uncertainty about the strength and durability of the recovery likely were more important factors.  Except in the extractive industries (drilling and mining), investment in nonresidential structures had continued to decline.  The near term outlook for commercial real estate investment remained weak despite a decline in vacancy rates in some markets.  Participants agreed that credit conditions did not appear to be an important restraint on investment spending by larger firms that have access to the capital markets.  Such firms were able to borrow readily and at relatively low rates; moreover, many businesses held substantial cash balances.  Most participants viewed weak demand for firms outputs as the primary problem; they saw substantial scope for stronger aggregate demand for goods and services to spur employment in a wide range of industries.  Some members expressed a concern that in this context any further adverse shocks could have disproportionate effects, resulting in a significant slowing in growth going forward.  The decline in mortgage rates since spring was generating increased mortgage refinancing activity that would accelerate repayments of principal on MBS held in the SOMA.  While reinvesting in Treasury securities was seen as preferable given current market conditions, reinvesting in MBS might become desirable if conditions were to change.","id":107},{"text":" The output of high technology items and other business equipment continued to rise.  On net, unit labor costs remained well below their level one year earlier.  Conditions in short term funding markets improved somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Nonetheless, commercial real estate markets remained under pressure.  Securities holdings by banks increased substantially in recent weeks.  Private payrolls and consumer spending had risen less than expected.  Some participants observed that small businesses continued to find credit hard to obtain.  Private sector payrolls grew sluggishly in recent months.  Bank lending has continued to contract.","id":107},{"text":" The average monthly gain in private payroll employment during the three months ending in July was small, considerably less than the average increase over the preceding three months.  Spreads of credit card interest rates over those on Treasury securities stayed elevated in May, while interest rate spreads on auto loans remained near their average level over the past decade.","id":107},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 16 17 meeting suggested that economic activity was increasing at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter and that labor market conditions had improved further.  On net, yields on longer term Treasury securities fell, corporate bond spreads widened, equity prices were little changed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated.  Results from the December Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that the dealers expectations for the timing of the first increase in the federal funds target range and the subsequent policy path were little changed from the October survey.  The average probability distribution of the expected date of liftoff continued to imply that the most likely date would be around the middle of 2015, with the distribution having narrowed slightly compared with the previous survey.  According to the December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, broker dealers had eased somewhat all of the terms on which they finance CMBS for most favored clients.  And although the projected path of the dollar was revised up, the staff revised down its estimate of how much the appreciation of the dollar since last summer would restrain projected growth in real GDP.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as supporting their view that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee s 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.  Many participants pointed to relatively high levels of consumer confidence as signaling near term strength in discretionary consumer spending, and most participants judged that the recent significant decline in energy prices would provide a boost to consumer spending.  Participants also cited solid gains in payroll employment, low interest rates, and the decline in levels of household debt relative to income as factors that were expected to support continued growth in consumer spending.  In contrast, residential construction continued to be slow, and recent readings on single family building permits suggested that this sluggishness was likely to continue in the short run.  Information from some regions pointed to a pickup in capital investment, although the continued decline in oil prices led business contacts to expect a slowdown in drilling activity and, if prices remain low, reduced capital investment in the oil and gas industries.  Several participants indicated that they expected slower economic growth abroad to negatively affect the United States economy, principally through lower net exports, but the net effect of lower oil prices on United States economic activity was anticipated to be positive.  A few participants spoke of the importance of explaining to the public how economic and financial conditions would influence the Committee s decisions regarding the appropriate path for the federal funds rate after normalization begins.  The Committee decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":72},{"text":" Both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio rose slightly, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons declined.  Data for October and November pointed toward a decline in real federal government purchases in the fourth quarter after a surprisingly large third quarter increase.  CRE loans on banks books expanded at a moderate pace in October and November, and issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) was strong.  Positive signals were also seen in the decline in the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and in the increase in the labor force participation rate.  A few participants suggested that the statement should focus on the economic conditions that would likely accompany the decision to raise rates.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.","id":72},{"text":" Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in October and November at a faster pace than in the third quarter.  Key factors that influence household spending pointed toward further solid PCE growth.  The pace of activity in the housing sector generally remained slow.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures edged down in October after rising slightly in the third quarter.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose about 2 percent over the year ending in the third quarter.  Oil prices continued to decline, likely reflecting favorable supply developments as well as some weakening in global demand.  The sharp decline in oil prices weighed on inflation compensation and left a mixed imprint on other asset markets.  Longer term nominal Treasury yields declined significantly, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Measures of residential mortgage lending conditions were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Credit conditions for mortgages remained tight for borrowers with less than pristine credit.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally stayed accommodative.  The staff s medium term forecast for real GDP growth was revised up a little on net.  Manufacturing activity was strong, as indicated by the index of industrial production and a variety of regional reports.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.","id":72},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the October 28 29 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the third quarter and that labor market conditions improved over the intermeeting period.  Industrial production increased briskly in September after having been little changed, on net, over the first two months of the quarter, and the rate of capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector moved up.  Readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys were generally consistent with moderate near term increases in factory output, but automakers production schedules for the fourth quarter pointed to some slowing in the pace of motor vehicle assemblies.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns about the global economic outlook apparently helped to prompt a sharp pullback from risky assets in the United States, but prices of those assets subsequently reversed much of their declines by the end of the intermeeting period.  On net, yields on longer term Treasury securities fell notably, United States equity prices edged down, corporate bond spreads widened modestly, and the dollar appreciated moderately against most other currencies.  However, the results from the Desk s October Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that the dealers projected path of the federal funds rate was little changed from the September survey, with dealers continuing to see the middle of next year as the most likely time of liftoff.  Yields on agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) declined roughly in line with comparable Treasury yields, while spreads on both investment and speculative grade corporate bonds widened modestly relative to Treasury securities.  In secured funding markets, some money market rates fell in the days leading up to quarter end, reportedly reflecting in part the announcement of the $300 billion overall size limit on the ON RRP exercise following the September FOMC meeting.  The staff s periodic report on potential risks to financial stability noted that recent developments in financial markets highlighted the potential for shocks to trigger increases in market volatility and declines in asset prices that could undermine financial stability.  As a result, resource slack was anticipated to decline steadily, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in the previous projection, and the unemployment rate was expected to gradually improve and to be at the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate in 2017.  With resource slack projected to diminish slowly and changes in commodity and import prices anticipated to be subdued, inflation was projected to rise gradually and to reach the Committee s objective in the longer run.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, most meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Many participants judged that the recent significant decline in energy prices would provide a boost to consumer spending over the near term, with several of them noting that the drop in gasoline prices would benefit lower income households in particular.  Among the other favorable factors that were expected to support continued growth in consumer spending, participants cited solid gains in payroll employment, low interest rates, rising consumer confidence, and the decline in levels of household debt relative to income.  Several participants judged that the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities as well as lower long term interest rates would likely provide an offset to the higher dollar and weaker foreign growth, or that the domestic recovery remained on a firm footing.  Some participants pointed out that, despite the market volatility, financial conditions remained highly accommodative and that further pockets of turbulence were likely to arise as the start of policy normalization approached.  In their discussion of communications regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, meeting participants agreed that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the appropriate path of the policy rate thereafter would depend on incoming economic data and their implications for the outlook.  However, other participants thought that the considerable time phrase was useful in communicating the Committee s policy intentions or that additional wording could be used to emphasize the data dependence of the Committee s decision process.  A couple of them noted that the removal of the considerable time phrase might be seen as signaling a significant shift in the stance of policy, potentially resulting in an unintended tightening of financial conditions.  It was noted that communication about post liftoff policy would pose challenges given the inherent uncertainty of the economic and financial outlook and the Committee s desire to retain flexibility to adjust policy in response to the incoming data.  The Committee agreed to include additional wording in the statement in order to emphasize that the Committee s decision on the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would be data dependent.  In particular, the statement would say that, if incoming information indicated faster progress toward the Committee s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":73},{"text":" Recent data on factors that tend to support household spending were mixed.  Credit flows to nonfinancial business picked up in September and early October.  Issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities stayed robust in September.  Conditions in most consumer credit markets remained accommodative during the third quarter.  Many participants commented on the turbulence in financial markets that occurred in mid October.  In the end, the Committee decided not to include such a reference.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":73},{"text":" New home sales were flat in September after moving up in August, and sales of existing single family homes moved essentially sideways over the past several months.  Meanwhile, inventories in most industries were about in line with sales; in the energy sector, inventories appeared somewhat lean despite substantial stockbuilding since earlier in the year.  Consumer energy prices declined further in September, largely reflecting continued declines in retail gasoline prices, and survey data suggested gasoline prices fell further over the first few weeks of October.  Market based measures suggested that the expected date of the first increase in the federal funds rate was pushed out from the third quarter of 2015 to late 2015.  A couple of participants reported expectations of a robust holiday sales season based on accumulating inventories of consumer goods or an increase in e commerce traffic and related transportation activity.  In addition, members considered the advantages and disadvantages of adding language to the statement to acknowledge recent developments in financial markets.  By keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, this policy was expected to help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  It would also note that, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated.  Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.","id":73},{"text":" Moreover, new orders for these capital goods continued to be above the level of shipments, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months.  In addition, other forward looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions, were consistent with moderate gains in business equipment spending in the near term.  Imports fell in June but then partly recovered in July, driven by swings in imports of oil and automotive products.  In the third quarter, household spending appeared to be normalizing in Japan, and production continued to rise in Mexico.  On net, the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions had limited effects on domestic financial markets.  Take up in ON RRP operations increased a little, on average, over the period relative to the previous intermeeting period.  Participants also discussed how the forward guidance language might evolve once the Committee decides that the current formulation no longer appropriately conveys its intentions about the future stance of policy.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint was diminishing and would soon be quite small.  Regarding the labor market, many members indicated that, although labor market conditions had generally continued to improve, there was still significant slack in labor markets.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.","id":74},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would decline slightly in the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in factory output in the near term.  Recent information pertaining to key factors that influence consumer spending were positive Real disposable incomes continued to increase in July, households net worth likely edged up as equity prices and home values rose somewhat further, and consumer sentiment as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved in August and early September.  Some participants noted that expectations for the path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes appeared to remain below most of the projections of the federal funds rate provided by Committee participants in the SEP, which represent each individual participant s assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate consistent with his or her economic outlook.  Most agreed that underutilization of labor resources remained significant; these participants noted variously that the level of nonfarm payroll jobs had only recently returned to its pre recession level, that the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons was still elevated relative to the level of unemployment, and that the labor force participation rate was still below assessments of its structural trend.  Participants views on the responsiveness of inflation to the level and change in resource utilization varied, with a few seeing labor markets as sufficiently tight that wages and prices would soon begin to move up noticeably but with some others indicating that inflation was unlikely to approach 2 percent until the unemployment rate falls below its longer run normal level.","id":74},{"text":" Sales of existing homes increased further in July, although new home sales declined.  Total real government purchases seemed to be roughly flat in the third quarter.  Consumer energy prices declined in both July and August, while consumer food prices rose.  Conditions in short term dollar funding markets were little changed.  The Federal Reserve continued its testing of ON RRP operations over the intermeeting period.  Among the other industries cited as relatively strong in recent months were transportation, energy, and services.  A couple of participants added that nonresidential construction activity was rising in their Districts.  Labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period.  Most participants anticipated that inflation would move gradually back toward its objective over the medium term.","id":74},{"text":" Staff Review of the Financial Situation Data releases on domestic economic activity were reportedly interpreted by financial market participants as somewhat better than expected, on balance, notwithstanding the disappointing employment report for August.  But the results from the Desk s September Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that the distribution of the likely date of liftoff across dealers shifted to somewhat earlier dates, and showed the second quarter of 2015 as the most likely date for liftoff.  Corporate bond issuance slowed in July and August, reflecting a fairly typical summer lull as well as the elevated volatility in the high yield bond market early in the intermeeting period, but issuance rebounded strongly in the first week of September.  The expansion in economic activity over the projection period was anticipated to steadily reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and temporarily move slightly below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate toward the end of the period.  Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, with several participants noting that the recent positive reports on retail sales, motor vehicle purchases, and health care spending had reduced their concern about weakness in the underlying pace of household spending.  However, one participant suggested that the leveraged loan market seemed to be moving into better balance, and that market participants appeared to be taking appropriate account of the changes in interest rates that might be associated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy.  The probability that investors attach to such low interest rate scenarios could pull the expected path of the federal funds rate computed from market quotes below most Committee participants assessments of appropriate policy as reported in the SEP.  However, businesses in several Districts continued to report upward pressure on wages in specific industries and occupations associated with labor shortages or difficult to fill jobs, while a couple of participants noted a more general rise in current or planned wage increases in their regions.  If employment and inflation converged more rapidly toward the Committee s goals than currently expected, the date of liftoff could be earlier, and subsequent increases in the federal funds rate target more rapid, than participants currently anticipated.  In addition, some participants saw the current forward guidance as appropriate in light of risk management considerations, which suggested that it would be prudent to err on the side of patience while awaiting further evidence of sustained progress toward the Committee s goals.  It was noted that providing explicit forward guidance regarding the future path of the federal funds rate might become less important once a highly accommodative stance of policy is no longer appropriate and the process of policy normalization is well under way.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":74},{"text":" In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate.  A few participants pointed out the relative strength in construction of and demand for multifamily units, which possibly was due to a shift in demand among younger homebuyers away from single family homes.  While the most recent estimate of nonfarm payroll employment showed a smaller monthly gain than earlier in the year, it followed six months in which increases had averaged more than 200,000.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.","id":74},{"text":" As a result, resource slack in this projection was anticipated to be somewhat narrower this year than in the previous forecast and to be taken up slowly over the projection period.  The staff s near term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster than anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory.  They also suggested that the Committee consider how promptly various financial stability concerns could be addressed, if need be, and which tools, including monetary policy and regulatory responses, would be most timely and effective in doing so.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","id":75},{"text":" Real GDP growth remained strong in the United Kingdom, and data for both Canada and the euro area showed improvement relative to the first quarter.  On net, yields on longer term Treasury securities fell, equity prices rose, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.  The VIX, an index of option implied volatility for one month returns on the S P 500 index, remained at low levels over the intermeeting period.  Labor market conditions improved in recent months according to participants reports on developments in their Districts as well as a range of national indicators.","id":75},{"text":" There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Participants expressed general support for the normalization approach outlined by the staff, though some noted reservations about one or more of its features.  They discussed options to address these concerns, including methods for limiting the program s size.  Participants requested additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization as background for further discussion at their next meeting.  The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion of approaches to policy normalization.  Measures of labor market conditions generally continued to improve during the intermeeting period.  In particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and real disposable personal income continued to rise in the second quarter.  Consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down in early July but was only slightly below its average over the first half of the year.  Existing home sales moved up during the second quarter but remained below year earlier levels, while new home sales declined.  Home prices continued to rise through May, though the rate of increase was less rapid than earlier in the year.  Meanwhile, business inventories generally appeared well aligned with sales, apart from the energy sector, where inventories remained below year earlier levels.  The broad trade weighted dollar was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Household spending appeared to be rising moderately and was expected to contribute to stronger economic growth in the second half of the year than in the first half.  Many participants reported continued improvement in sentiment among their business contacts and noted positive readings from recent regional and national surveys of manufacturing and service sector activity.  In addition, higher energy prices continued to provide support for activity in the energy sector.  The reports from their business contacts provided support for participants expectation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year.  In some cases, the information from businesses suggested increases in spending on capital equipment or a pickup in investment in commercial and industrial construction and transportation.  They suggested that the guidance should more clearly communicate how policy setting would respond to the evolution of economic data.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.","id":75},{"text":" Almost all participants agreed that it would be appropriate to retain the federal funds rate as the key policy rate, and they supported continuing to target a range of 25 basis points for this rate at the time of liftoff and for some time thereafter.  Most participants anticipated that, at least initially, the IOER rate would be set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate would be set at the bottom of the federal funds target range.  However, many other participants thought that such a strategy might result in insufficient control of money market rates at liftoff, which could cause confusion about the likely path of monetary policy or raise questions about the Committee s ability to implement policy effectively.  Automakers production schedules indicated that light motor vehicle assemblies would increase in the third quarter, and readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys were consistent with moderate gains in factory output in the near term.  Consumer food price inflation also increased in the second quarter, reflecting the effects of drought and disease on crop and livestock production; however, spot prices for crops moved down in recent weeks, and futures prices pointed to lower prices for livestock in the year ahead.  Participants generally agreed that both the recent improvement in labor market conditions and the cumulative progress over the past year had been greater than anticipated and that labor market conditions had moved noticeably closer to those viewed as normal in the longer run.  However, many participants continued to see a larger gap between current labor market conditions and those consistent with their assessments of normal levels of labor utilization than indicated by the difference between the unemployment rate and estimates of its longer run normal level.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.","id":75},{"text":" Moreover, the ON RRP exercise appeared to have continued to help firm the floor under money market interest rates.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, al though the extent of the restraint was diminishing.","id":75},{"text":" As a result, the rate of industrial capacity utilization rose in recent months.  Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products were estimated to have increased slowly in the first quarter as a whole.  Nominal business spending for nonresidential structures was essentially unchanged in April.  Real state and local government purchases appeared to edge up going into the second quarter.  Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period had limited effects in financial markets.  Yields on short and medium term nominal Treasury securities increased slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Measures of longer horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities remained about steady.  Conditions in unsecured short term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  The number of participants and the total amount awarded increased over the course of the first five operations.  While issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities started the year a bit slow relative to 2013, it has picked up recently.  Both mortgage applications for home purchases and refinancing applications remained at very low levels.  The recovery in the housing sector was reported to have remained slow in all but a few areas of the country.  Information from participants business contacts suggested capital spending was likely to increase going forward.  At the same time, it was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to promote the favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion.  Labor market conditions generally continued to improve over the intermeeting period.  Reports from business contacts were mixed, spanning an absence of price pressures in some Districts and rising input costs in others.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.","id":76},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would step up in the coming months, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national manufacturing surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in factory output in the near term.  Recent data on the book value of inventories, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries except in the energy sector, where inventories appeared unusually low after having been drawn down during the winter.  Results from the Desk s June Survey of Primary Dealers indicated no change in the dealers consensus expectation about the most likely timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target but showed a lower median longer run level of the federal funds rate relative to the April survey.  With longer run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to diminish slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward the Committee s objective.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was rebounding in the second quarter following a surprisingly large decline in real GDP in the first quarter of the year.  Several of those reports pointed to an absence of wage pressures, while some others indicated that tight labor markets or shortages of skilled workers were leading to upward pressure on wages in some areas or occupations and that an increasing proportion of small businesses were planning to raise wages.  Some committee members had been asked by members of the public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases continues as expected, the final reduction would come in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a $10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction.  Accordingly, the Committee agreed that beginning in July, it would add to its holdings of agency MBS at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month, and it would add to its holdings of Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month.  The Committee agreed to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guidance about how it would assess the appropriate timing of the first increase in the target rate and the anticipated behavior of the federal funds rate after it is raised.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in July, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month.

In contrast, some others expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations because they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack.  While the current asset purchase program is not on a preset course, participants generally agreed that if the economy evolved as they anticipated, the program would likely be completed later this year.","id":76},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 17 18 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped significantly early in the year but that economic growth had bounced back in recent months.  Both imports and exports recovered from weak readings in February, with imports of consumer goods, automotive products, and capital goods rising significantly and exports of capital goods and industrial supplies showing particular strength.  The expected path of ECB policy rates implied by market quotes for short term interest rates fell over the intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing of policy announced by the ECB at its June meeting.  In their view, an important element in the economic outlook was a pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ongoing employment gains, that would be expected to support a sustained rise in consumer spending.  While information about mortgage lending was mixed, a number of participants reported increases in C I lending by banks in their Districts, a pickup in loan demand at banks, or better credit quality for borrowers.  The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":76},{"text":" Other forward looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, were also consistent with increased outlays for business equipment in the coming months.  Federal Reserve communications garnered significant attention from market participants over the period but appeared to have only a modest net effect on their expectations for monetary policy.  However, subsequent communications including the release of the minutes of the March FOMC meeting appeared to mostly reverse the earlier change in expectations.","id":77},{"text":"Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as the System open market operations during the period since the Committee met on March 18 19, 2014.  By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The votes to renew the Federal Reserve s participation in these arrangements were taken at this meeting because provisions in the arrangements specify that the Federal Reserve provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  Market participants cited a number of factors as contributing to the drop in long term yields so far this year, including portfolio reallocation by large institutional investors, the trading strategies pursued by some investors, and safe haven flows.  The seasonal paydown of short term Treasury debt following the April tax date was accompanied by a notable pickup in participation at ON RRP operations, but Treasury repo rates generally remained very close to the ON RRP rate of 5 basis points.  Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained robust, on balance, notwithstanding subdued bond issuance in April that was attributed to typical constraints on issuance during the period when many firms are reporting their earnings.  Relatively strong capital profiles of large domestic banking firms, low levels of aggregate leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and moderate use of short term wholesale funding across the financial sector were seen as the primary factors supporting overall financial stability.  However, the staff report also highlighted valuation pressures in some segments of the equity market, continued strong demand for corporate debt instruments and associated pressures on underwriting standards, and liquidity risks associated with fixed income mutual funds.  The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a faster pace over the next few years than it did last year, and that it would rise more quickly than the growth rate of potential output.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants generally indicated that their assessment of the economic outlook had not changed materially since the March meeting.  In addition, a few participants judged that additional clarity about the Committee s reaction function could be particularly important in the event that future economic conditions necessitate a more rapid rise in the target federal funds rate than the Committee currently anticipates.  Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic growth had picked up recently, following a sharp slowdown during the winter due in part to unusually severe weather conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.","id":77},{"text":" There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  The production of motor vehicles and parts declined in March, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector expanded.  The export declines were concentrated in aircraft and petroleum products, while exports of consumer goods rose.  Rising imports of services and automotive products offset declines in imports of oil and capital goods.  Indicators of foreign economic activity suggested continued expansion in the first quarter but at a rate somewhat below that in the fourth quarter.  Measures of longer horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities were little changed.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained fairly stable over the intermeeting period.  The allotment limit was subsequently increased to $10 billion per counterparty in early April.  Some initial public offerings were reportedly put on hold as prices of small capitalization stocks declined.  Student and auto loans expanded at a robust pace, while credit card debt outstanding stayed flat, as it had been in recent months.  Financing conditions in the consumer asset backed securities market remained favorable, and issuance continued to be solid.  Investor sentiment toward EMEs continued to improve over the period despite incoming data that were somewhat weaker than expected.  Participants discussed a range of research and analysis bearing on the amount of available slack remaining in the labor market.  While household spending appeared to be rising more rapidly, business fixed investment had edged down and the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, but the extent of that restraint had diminished.

Accordingly, the Committee agreed that, beginning in May, it would add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and would add to its holdings of longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month.

Manufacturing production was roughly flat, on balance, in January and February, in part because of the effects of the severe winter weather, which held down both motor vehicle output and production outside the motor vehicle sector.  The increases in the interest rate offered by the Federal Reserve in its ON RRP exercise, along with the increases in caps for individual bids, also may have contributed to higher levels of activity at daily operations.  Moreover, it was noted that some of the pickup in economic growth that had appeared to have been indicated by the data available at the January meeting had been reversed by subsequent data revisions.  While there was general agreement that slack remains in the labor market, participants expressed a range of views regarding the amount of slack and how well the unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of labor market conditions.  Beginning in April, the Desk is directed to purchase longer term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of about $25 billion per month.

The labor force participation rate, along with the employment to population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.  Starts for both new single family homes and multifamily units were lower in January and February than at the end of last year.  Total real state and local government purchases also appeared to be about flat going into the first quarter.  In Canada, however, severe winter weather appeared to have held down economic activity in early 2014.  Measures of longer horizon inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation protected securities also declined somewhat.  The Federal Reserve continued its fixed rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise.  Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by a solid finish to the corporate earnings season.  Issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities was robust in February after a slow start in January.  Financing conditions in residential mortgage markets stayed tight, even as further incremental signs of easing emerged.  Financial market sentiment abroad appeared to improve over the period, particularly with respect to the stresses that had developed in some EMEs just prior to the January FOMC meeting.  The available readings on consumer spending, residential construction, and business investment pointed to less spending growth in the first quarter than the staff had previously expected.  Most participants noted that unusually severe winter weather had held down economic activity during the early months of the year.  Participants expected economic activity to pick up as the weather related disruptions to spending and production dissipated.  Slackening demand from institutional investors was cited as another factor behind the decline in home sales.  In their discussion of labor market developments, participants noted further improvement, on balance, in labor market conditions.  Several participants cited low nominal wage growth as pointing to the existence of continued labor market slack.  In their discussion of recent financial developments, participants saw financial conditions as generally consistent with the Committee s policy intentions.  Most participants preferred replacing the numerical thresholds with a qualitative description of the factors that would influence the Committee s decision to begin raising the federal funds rate.

Households net worth probably continued to expand as equity prices and home values increased further, and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers during February and early March remained above its average last fall; however, real disposable incomes only edged up, on balance, in December and January.  Federal spending data in January and February pointed toward real federal government purchases being roughly flat in the first quarter, as the general downtrend in purchases seemed likely to be about offset by a reversal of the effects of the partial government shutdown during the fourth quarter.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market conditions in the United States over the intermeeting period appeared to have been influenced by an easing of concerns about developments in the EMEs but relatively little affected by the generally weaker than expected economic data, which market participants appeared to attribute in large part to the temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather.  On balance, United States financial conditions remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment The expected path of the federal funds rate was little changed, longer term yields on Treasury securities edged down, equity prices rose, speculative grade corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly.  In addition, a number of participants observed that an upward shift was arguably warranted by the improvement in participants outlooks for the labor market since December and therefore need not be viewed as signifying a less accommodative reaction function.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, members decided that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting.  However, another member indicated that adding the new language at this stage could be beneficial for the effectiveness of policy because financial conditions depend on both the length of time that the federal funds rate is at the effective lower bound and on the expected path that the federal funds rate will follow once policy firming begins.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.","id":78},{"text":" Recent information on key factors that influence household spending, along with the expectation that the weather would return to seasonal norms, generally pointed toward additional gains in PCE in the coming months.  Over the same year long period, the employment cost index and average hourly earnings for all employees rose only a little faster than consumer price inflation.  Early in the intermeeting period, market rates on repurchase agreements were close to the fixed rate offered in the exercise, prompting high take up in the ON RRP operations.  Reflecting the larger size of the ON RRP exercises and the reduced pace of asset purchases, the rate of increase in the monetary base slowed over January and February.  One participant voiced concern about high levels of margin debt and of equity market valuations as well as a notable shift into commodity investments.  Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions.  Members also considered statement language that would provide information about the anticipated behavior of the federal funds rate once it is raised above its effective lower bound.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.","id":78},{"text":" The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.  In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to use agents in agency MBS related transactions.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph.  The Committee voted unanimously to amend the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations in the form shown below.  The Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations was amended to remove language regarding the transmission of pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department because this language duplicated language in the Program for Security of FOMC Information.  The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to maintain for the System Open Market Account (subject to the requirements of section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers) 3.  All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Treasury; B.  All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the United States dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee informed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee.  The Chairman shall keep the Committee informed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee.  Would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants generally agreed that only minor updates were required at this meeting.  For example, some participants advocated an explicit indication that inflation persistently below the Committee s 2 percent longer run objective and inflation persistently above that objective would be equally undesirable.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Rules of Organization to add the position of deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.  By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Simon Potter and Lorie K. Logan to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account, respectively, on the understanding that their selection was subject to their being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Secretary s note Advice subsequently was received that the manager and deputy manager selections indicated above were satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as System open market operations during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee met on December 17 18, 2013.  The number of participating counterparties and total allotment in the daily operations increased in late December, in part reflecting the fact that overnight secured rates were low compared with the fixed rate offered in the operations as well as the increase in the cap on individual counterparty bids to $3 billion from $1 billion that was implemented on December 23, 2013.  Counterparties year end balance sheet adjustments also boosted participation for a time; the ON RRP operations reportedly helped limit downward pressure on money market rates around year end.  Under the terms of the proposal, the interest rate on ON RRPs would remain between 0 and 5 basis points.  The proposed changes were intended to allow the Committee to obtain additional information about the potential usefulness of ON RRP operations for affecting market interest rates when that step becomes appropriate.  It was remarked that the additional insights obtained from the exercise could be useful in the context of the Committee s future discussions about monetary policy implementation over the medium and longer term.  Any change to the offered rate within the range specified above or the per counterparty bid limits will require approval of the Chairman.  The System Open Market Account manager will notify the FOMC in advance about any changes to the terms of operations.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 28 29 meeting indicated that the rate of economic growth picked up in the second half of 2013.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded by less in December than in the previous two months, perhaps partly because of unusually bad weather.  Among other indicators of labor market conditions, the rate of job openings edged up in recent months, and the share of small businesses reporting that they had hard to fill positions trended up.  Indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with a further expansion in factory output early this year, but automakers production schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would decline in the first quarter.  In December, the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE increased strongly, although sales of light motor vehicles declined after posting a large gain in November.  Consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved, on balance, in December and early January after a decline in the fall of 2013.  Single family housing starts increased in November and only partly reversed that gain in December, while permits for new construction rose a little, on balance, in the fourth quarter.  New home sales declined in November and December but were nonetheless higher than in the third quarter, and existing home sales flattened out in December after decreasing for several months.  Although nominal new orders for these capital goods declined in December and November s increase was revised down, the level of orders remained above that of shipments, pointing to further increases in shipments in subsequent months.  Data on book value inventories suggested little change in the pace of nonfarm inventory investment in the fourth quarter, and the available information did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries.  Real federal government purchases likely fell sharply in the fourth quarter because of continued declines in defense spending and the temporary partial shutdown of the federal government in October.  Total United States consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was a little under 1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, well below the Committee s 2 percent longer term objective.  Over that period, consumer energy prices declined, consumer food prices rose modestly, and core PCE prices which exclude consumer food and energy prices increased slightly more than 1 percent.  Inflation in emerging market economies remained moderate on average, although Brazil, India, and Turkey again tightened monetary policy during the intermeeting period in response to concerns about inflation and currency depreciation.  The policy tightening in Turkey was particularly sharp and followed several days of heightened financial market pressures toward the end of the intermeeting period.  While investors were somewhat surprised by the FOMC s decision at its December meeting to reduce the pace of its asset purchases, the policy action and associated communications appeared to have only a limited effect on market participants outlook for the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  Results from the Desk s survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the January meeting indicated that dealers anticipated only minor changes to the Committee s postmeeting statement.  Repo rates were quite low at the end of the year and remained low through most of January, leading to increased participation in the Federal Reserve s ON RRP operations, with a substantial temporary increase in take up at year end.  Primarily reflecting the increased participation in the exercise, reserve balances expanded more slowly and the rate of increase in the monetary base slowed in December.  Reflecting the improved outlook for economic activity and despite mixed fourth quarter earnings results, the stock prices of bank holding companies rose notably and spreads on credit default swaps for the largest bank holding companies narrowed somewhat.  According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease their lending standards and some loan terms on balance; they also experienced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter.  The volume of mortgage applications for home purchases held about steady since the previous FOMC meeting while refinance applications remained at very low levels.  Despite tight mortgage availability and subdued borrowing, house prices continued to increase in November, although not as quickly as earlier in 2013.  In addition, debt issuance by both governments and banks in the European periphery picked up, and sovereign yield spreads in those countries were flat to down, on balance, over the period.  Local currency yields rose in some emerging market economies, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey, and short term interbank rates in China were volatile and trended higher over the period.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated against most other currencies over the period, with particularly large increases against the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira.  In addition, the staff revised downward its view of the pace at which potential output had increased over recent years and would increase this year and next.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants generally noted that economic activity had strengthened more in the second half of 2013 than they had expected at the time of the December meeting.  Although the government shutdown likely damped economic growth somewhat, the extent of restraint on growth from fiscal policy diminished late in the year.  However, several participants observed that temporary factors had helped boost real GDP during the second half, pointing specifically to the substantial contributions from net exports and increased inventory investment.  Although the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat in recent months, a number of participants reported solid activity in their Districts.  While inventory investment would likely come down from its recent unusually high level, participants heard more reports that the business sector was willing to increase spending on capital projects.  In discussing financial developments over the intermeeting period, several participants noted that the Committee s December decision to make a modest reduction in the monthly pace of asset purchases had not resulted in an adverse market reaction.  Nevertheless, participants agreed that a number of developments in financial markets needed to be watched carefully, including the financing situation of the Puerto Rican government and particularly the unfolding events in emerging markets.  A few participants judged that the decline in participation for younger and prime age workers likely reflected the slow recovery in jobs and wages and so might be reversed as labor market conditions strengthened.  A few participants noted worker shortages in specific regions and occupations, with one District reporting widespread shortages of skilled labor leading to emerging labor cost pressures.  However, a number of participants saw the low rates of increase in most measures of wages as consistent with continued labor market slack.  Participants noted that inflation persistently below the Committee s objective would pose risks to economic performance and that inflation developments would need to be monitored carefully.  A couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in light of the strength of the economy in the second half of 2013.  Several participants argued that, in the absence of an appreciable change in the economic outlook, there should be a clear presumption in favor of continuing to reduce the pace of purchases by a total of $10 billion at each FOMC meeting.  Some participants favored quantitative guidance along the lines of the existing thresholds, while others preferred a qualitative approach that would provide additional information regarding the factors that would guide the Committee s policy decisions.  A few participants raised the possibility that it might be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate relatively soon.  One participant cited evidence that the equilibrium real interest rate had moved higher, and a couple of them noted that some standard policy rules tended to suggest that the federal funds rate should be raised above its effective lower bound before the middle of this year.  Household spending and business fixed investment had advanced more quickly in recent months than earlier in 2013, while the recovery in the housing sector had slowed somewhat.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint had diminished.  In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, all members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","id":79},{"text":" 3.  3.  3.","id":79},{"text":" Real state and local government purchases rose markedly in the third quarter.  The gains in exports were fairly widespread across categories and were led by sales of consumer goods, industrial supplies, and agricultural products.  The employment cost index expanded a little more slowly than the compensation per hour measure over the same yearlong period.  Gross equity issuance by the nonfinancial corporate sector in October and November reached levels not seen in a decade.  Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations picked up again after a dip related to the fiscal standoff in October.  Responses to the December 2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) suggested that demand for funding for CMBS picked up since September.  In contrast, credit card balances moved sideways, and ABS issuance in that sector stayed flat.  Mortgage rates rose over the intermeeting period to levels about 100 basis points above their early May lows.  On balance, refinancing applications were down substantially since May while purchase applications declined much less.  Spreads on credit default swaps for the largest bank holding companies also moved lower, on net.  Meanwhile, the monetary base continued to expand rapidly, primarily reflecting the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve s asset purchases.  Those factors, in total, more than offset a higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Consumer spending appeared to be strengthening, with solid gains in retail sales in recent months and a rebound in motor vehicle sales in November.  Participants heard positive reports from their contacts in the technology, rail, freight, and airline industries, and activity in the energy sector remained strong.  Some participants cited research that found that demographic and other structural factors, particularly rising retirements by older workers, accounted for much of the recent decline in participation.  Domestic financial markets were influenced importantly over the intermeeting period by Federal Reserve communications and by economic data that were generally better than market participants expected.  Moreover, participants generally anticipated that the improvement in labor market conditions would continue, and most had become more confident in that outlook.  Some other participants preferred a larger reduction in purchases at this meeting and future reductions that would bring the program to a close relatively quickly.  Participants also considered the potential for clarifying or strengthening the Committee s forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing market slowed somewhat in recent months.  Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of the restraint may have begun to diminish.

Real nonfarm inventory investment increased noticeably in the third quarter, but recent book value data for inventory to sales ratios, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries.  Real federal government purchases declined somewhat in the third quarter but appeared likely to decrease more substantially in the fourth quarter, reflecting the effect of the temporary partial government shutdown in October and further cuts in defense spending in October and November.  Foreign economic activity strengthened in the third quarter, as the euro area continued to recover from its recent recession, economic growth picked up in China after slowing in the first half of the year, and the Mexican economy rebounded from a second quarter contraction.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market developments over the intermeeting period appeared to be driven largely by incoming data on employment and economic activity that exceeded investor expectations as well as by Federal Reserve communications.  In part, a variety of Federal Reserve communications were seen as strengthening the Committee s forward guidance for the federal funds rate and contributing to the stability of expectations for the near term path of the federal funds rate in the face of an improved economic outlook.  In the residential mortgage market, several large lenders were reported to have eased their underwriting standards slightly, but data suggested that mortgage lenders generally continued to be reluctant to lend to borrowers with less than pristine credit scores.  Relatively strong capital profiles of large domestic banking firms, low levels and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the nonfinancial sectors, and some reduction in reliance on short term wholesale funding across the financial sector were seen as factors supporting financial stability in the current environment.  However, the staff report noted that the complexity and interconnectedness of large financial institutions, along with some apparent increases in investor appetite for higher yielding assets and associated pressures on underwriting standards remained potential sources of risk to the financial system.  Almost all participants continued to project that the rate of growth of economic activity would strengthen in coming years, and all anticipated that the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with their current assessments of its longer run normal value.  The projected improvement in economic activity was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, diminished fiscal policy restraint, and a pickup in global economic growth, as well as a further easing of credit conditions and continued improvements in household balance sheets.  These included expectations that mortgage interest rates would remain relatively favorable, that rising home values would boost household wealth and further reduce the number of borrowers with underwater mortgages, that consumer incomes and confidence would continue to rise as employment expanded, and that a pickup in household formation would support the demand for housing.  However, participants generally judged that the extent of the restraint may have begun to diminish as the effects of the payroll tax increases earlier in the year seem to have waned, and the drag on real activity from restrictive fiscal policies was expected to decline further going forward.  In their discussion of the appropriate path for monetary policy, participants considered whether the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions since the asset purchase program began in September 2012 and the associated improvement in the outlook for the labor market warranted a reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  Many commented that progress to date had been meaningful, and some expressed the view that the criterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market was likely to be met in the coming year if the economy evolved as expected.  A few participants discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of using medians of the projections of the federal funds rate from the SEP as a means of communicating the likely path of short term interest rates.  In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, most members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood that the improvement would be sustained indicated that the Committee could appropriately begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting.  It was noted that this language might appear calendar based rather than conditional on economic and financial developments, and one member objected to having forward guidance that might be seen as relatively inflexible in response to changes in members views about the appropriate path of the target federal funds rate.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":81},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation In general, the data available at the time of the October 29 30 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to rise at a moderate pace; the set of information reviewed for this meeting, however, was reduced somewhat by delays in selected statistical releases associated with the partial shutdown of the federal government earlier in the month.  Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would be slightly lower in the coming months, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further gains in factory output in the near term.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were somewhat mixed Households net worth likely expanded further as both equity values and home prices rose in recent months, and real disposable incomes increased solidly in August, but measures of consumer sentiment declined in September and October.  Preliminary data indicated that growth in M2 picked up temporarily in early October amid uncertainty about the passage of debt limit legislation; deposits increased sharply as institutional investors appeared to shift from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible redemptions.  The acceleration over the medium term was expected to be bolstered by the gradual abatement of headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery such as household sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal restraint as well as improved prospects for global growth.  A few participants expressed concerns about the eventual economic impact of the change in financial conditions since the spring; in particular, increases in mortgage rates and home prices had reduced the affordability of housing, and the higher rates were at least partly responsible for some slowing in that sector.  Nonetheless, some participants noted that, if the Committee were going to contemplate cutting purchases in the future based on criteria other than improvement in the labor market outlook, such as concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset purchases, it would need to communicate effectively about those other criteria.  A calendar based step down would run counter to the data dependent, state contingent nature of the current asset purchase program, but it would be easier to communicate and might help the public separate the Committee s purchase program from its policy for the federal funds rate and the overall stance of policy.  Alternatively, the policy statement could indicate that even after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, the Committee anticipated keeping the rate below its longer run equilibrium value for some time, as economic headwinds were likely to diminish only slowly.  In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective.","id":81},{"text":" Private nonfarm employment rose in September but at a slower pace than in the previous month, while total government employment increased at a solid rate.  The recovery in the housing sector appeared to continue, although recent data in this sector were limited.  Five and 10 year yields on both nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities declined 30 basis points or more over the intermeeting period.  However, these effects eased quickly after an agreement to raise the debt limit was reached in mid October.  Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and commercial paper, which had been particularly strong in September, slowed a bit in October.  Mortgage refinancing applications were down dramatically compared with May, but purchase applications were only a bit below their earlier level.  Yields on 20 year general obligation municipal bonds decreased about in line with other longer term market rates over the intermeeting period.  Foreign stock prices rose, foreign yields and yield spreads declined, and the dollar depreciated against most other currencies.  However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm.  Manufacturing activity in parts of the country was reported to have picked up, and auto sales remained strong.  Reports from several Districts indicated that commercial real estate and housing related business activity continued to advance.  Financial quotes suggested that markets moved out the date at which they expected to see the Committee first increase the federal funds rate target.  Nevertheless, term premiums appeared to only partially retrace their rise of earlier in the year, and longer term interest rates remained well above their levels in the spring.  One participant stated that the extended period of near zero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry, as net interest margins remained under pressure.  With regard to future reductions in asset purchases, participants discussed how those might be split across asset classes.  No decisions on the substance were taken, and participants generally noted the usefulness of planning for various contingencies.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, but the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months, and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth.  Members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting.  While there was some support for adding this language at some stage, a range of concerns were expressed about including it at this meeting.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.

In this context, participants discussed the financial market response to the Committee s decisions at its June and September meetings and, more generally, the complexities associated with communications about the Committee s current policy tools.","id":81},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would remain roughly flat in the coming months, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to moderate increases in factory output in the near term.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat more slowly than earlier anticipated, and they generally indicated that the broad contours of the outlook further out had not changed materially since their July meeting.  In their discussion of the path for monetary policy, participants debated the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the pace of the Committee s asset purchases at this meeting, focusing importantly on whether the conditions presented to the public in June for reducing the pace of asset purchases had yet been met.  In general, those who preferred to maintain for now the pace of purchases viewed incoming data as having been on the disappointing side and, despite clear improvements in labor market conditions since the purchase program s inception in September 2012, were not yet adequately confident of continued progress.  With regard to adjustments in the pace of asset purchases, whether at this or a future meeting, a few participants expressed a preference for not cutting MBS purchases but reducing purchases only of Treasury securities initially, with the intent of continuing to support the recovery in the housing sector.  To the extent that financial markets have at times interpreted the Committee s communications regarding the asset purchase program as also signaling information about the federal funds rate target, participants thought it might be important to reiterate the distinction between the two, and a clarification or strengthening of the forward guidance might help to reinforce this message.  Members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but indicated that the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.","id":82},{"text":" On net over the period, the dollar ended little changed on a trade weighted basis against a broad set of currencies, but it appreciated notably against the currencies of India, Indonesia, and Turkey.  In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.  One participant noted that, notwithstanding the recent rise in interest rates, net interest margins remained under pressure at community and regional banks, and as a result many of these banks continued to add to risk exposures.  In particular, if economic headwinds died away only slowly, as a number of participants expected, the achievement of the Committee s employment and price stability objectives would likely require keeping the federal funds rate below its longer run equilibrium value for some time even as economic conditions improved.  Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee s economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","id":82},{"text":" However, the risks were viewed as skewed to the downside, reflecting concerns about the economic effects of the recent tightening in United States financial market conditions, the resolution of federal fiscal policy issues in the coming months, the economic and financial stresses in the EMEs, and the ability of the United States economy to weather potential future adverse shocks.  The participants who spoke in favor of moderating the pace of securities purchases at this meeting also cited the incoming data, but viewed those data as broadly consistent with the Committee s outlook for the labor market at the time of the June FOMC meeting when the contingent expectation that the pace of asset purchases would be reduced later in the year was first presented to the public.","id":82},{"text":" Taking a range of data into account, participants generally agreed that labor market conditions had improved meaningfully since the start of the asset purchase program in September 2012.  Many of these participants had revised down their forecasts for economic activity or pointed to near term risks and uncertainties.","id":82},{"text":" Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were flat in July.  The United States international trade deficit narrowed substantially in June before widening in July to a level near its second quarter average.  Stock prices for financial sector firms underperformed the broad equity market somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained solid in the face of higher longer term interest rates.  The pace of home price appreciation moderated a bit in July, although it was still strong.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":82},{"text":" The labor force participation rate also decreased, leaving the employment to population ratio essentially unchanged in recent months.  But it was noted that recent softness in housing starts and home sales might well reflect some restraint from those higher rates.  Participants also discussed the potential for clarifying or strengthening the Committee s forward guidance for the federal funds rate.","id":82},{"text":" Measures of firms hiring plans moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance declined, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons decreased a little.  The staff reported on potential risks to financial stability, including those highlighted by the rise in yields and volatility on longer term fixed income securities since the spring.  Auto sales, however, remained strong, supported in part by steady interest rates on auto loans, which, unlike mortgage rates, did not rise substantially in recent months.  Some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one District, contacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor shortages.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee s longer run objective, but longer term inflation expectations have remained stable.","id":82},{"text":" The federal funds rate path implied by financial market quotes steepened slightly, on net, but the results from the Desk s July survey of primary dealers showed little change in dealers views of the most likely timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target.  Factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic activity included highly accommodative monetary policy, improving credit availability, receding effects of fiscal restraint, continued strength in housing and auto sales, and improvements in household and business balance sheets.  Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained elevated, and the continuing low readings on the participation rate and the employment to population ratio, together with a high incidence of workers being employed part time for economic reasons, were generally seen as indicating that overall labor market conditions remained weak.  With economic activity and employment continuing to grow despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained overall, members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since last fall.  At the same time, a few others pointed to the contingent plan that had been articulated on behalf of the Committee the previous month, and suggested that it might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as outlined in that plan.  The Committee decided to indicate in the statement that it reaffirmed its view rather than simply expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":83},{"text":" Manufacturing production expanded in June, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization edged up.  Home prices continued to rise strongly through May, and sales of both new and existing homes increased, on balance, in May and June.  Business inventories in most industries appeared to be broadly aligned with sales in recent months.  The United States international trade deficit widened in May as exports fell slightly and imports rose.  Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses showed mixed changes.  Mortgage purchase applications declined modestly through July even as refinancing applications fell off sharply with the rise in mortgage rates.  Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, and the housing sector was strengthening.  Consumer spending continued to advance, but spending on items other than motor vehicles was relatively soft.  Some participants pointed out that once productivity growth picked up, faster economic growth would be required to support further increases in employment along the lines seen of late.  A few participants saw other forms of communication as better suited for this purpose.  Members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.","id":83},{"text":" Auto production and sales were near pre recession levels, and automakers schedules indicated that the rate of motor vehicle assemblies would continue at a similar pace in the coming months.  Other recent forward looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, were mixed and pointed to modest gains in business equipment spending in the near term.  The staff s broad nominal dollar index moved up as the dollar appreciated against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies, consistent with the larger increase in United States interest rates.  The staff continued to judge that much of the recent softness in consumer price inflation would be transitory and that inflation would pick up somewhat in the second half of this year.  Conditions in the labor market improved further as private payrolls rose at a solid pace in June, but the unemployment rate remained elevated.  Under that outlook, if economic conditions improved broadly as expected, the Committee would moderate the pace of its securities purchases later this year.  And if economic conditions continued to develop broadly as anticipated, the Committee would reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps and conclude the purchase program around the middle of 2014.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector was strengthening, but mortgage rates had risen somewhat and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.","id":83},{"text":" However, some key factors that tend to support household spending were more positive in recent months; in particular, gains in equity values and home prices boosted household net worth, and consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose in July to its highest level since the onset of the recession.  Staff Economic Outlook The data received since the forecast was prepared for the previous FOMC meeting suggested that real GDP growth was weaker, on net, in the first half of the year than had been anticipated.3 Nevertheless, the staff still expected that real GDP would accelerate in the second half of the year.  A number of participants indicated, however, that they were somewhat less confident about a near term pickup in economic growth than they had been in June; factors cited in this regard included recent increases in mortgage rates, higher oil prices, slow growth in key United States export markets, and the possibility that fiscal restraint might not lessen.  However, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past.  Several participants favored including such additional information in the policy statement to be released following the current meeting; several others indicated that providing such information would be most useful when the time came for the Committee to begin reducing the pace of its securities purchases, reasoning that earlier inclusion might trigger an unintended tightening of financial conditions.","id":83},{"text":" Consumer price inflation was subdued, partly reflecting transitory influences.  Nominal business spending for nonresidential construction increased in April after it had declined in the first quarter.  Gains in average hourly earnings for all employees were muted, on balance, in April and May.  Foreign economic growth remained sluggish so far this year.  Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained strong in May, especially through bond issuance.  A pickup in bank lending to small businesses was also reported.","id":84},{"text":" In contrast, increases in commercial real estate loans picked up, especially at large banks.  Several participants worried that higher mortgage rates and bond yields could slow the recovery in the housing market and restrain business expansion.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.","id":84},{"text":" In Japan, where recent policy measures appeared to have boosted household confidence, economic growth picked up noticeably early in the year.  The staff reported on potential risks to financial stability, including the stability of banking firms, nonbank financial intermediaries, and asset markets.  In addition, consumer sentiment improved over the intermeeting period, which some participants attributed to rising house prices and gains in the stock market.  Some businesses, particularly smaller firms, were again reported to be concerned about the implications of new health care regulations for their labor costs.  However, some others commented that any adverse effects of the increase in rates on financial conditions more broadly appeared to be limited.  However, some saw potential difficulties in being able to convey succinctly the desired information in the postmeeting statement.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.","id":84},{"text":" The ongoing declines in real state and local government purchases appeared to moderate over recent months; the payrolls of these governments expanded in April and May, but state and local construction expenditures continued to decline noticeably.  While the federal sequestration and the tax increases that became effective earlier in the year were expected to be a substantial drag on economic activity this year, the magnitude and timing of the effects remained unclear.","id":84},{"text":" Forward rates two to three years ahead derived from overnight index swaps shifted up 25 to 40 basis points over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting both an increase in the expected path for the federal funds rate and an increase in term premiums.  Responses to the June Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms generally suggested little change over the past three months in the credit terms applicable to important classes of counterparties and in the use of financial leverage by most classes of counterparties covered by the survey.  However, some participants noted that they remained uncertain about the projected pickup in growth of economic activity in coming quarters, and thus about the prospects for further improvement in labor market conditions, given that, in recent years, forecasts of a sustained pickup in growth had not been realized.  Over the past year, both core and overall consumer price inflation trended lower; participants cited various alternative measures of consumer price inflation, including the trimmed mean PCE and CPI as well as the sticky price CPI, that suggested that the slowing was broad based.  With economic activity and employment continuing to grow at a moderate pace despite tighter fiscal policy, and with global financial conditions less strained, members generally saw the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall.  While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.","id":84},{"text":" Over the intermeeting period, yields on 10 year sovereign debt of the advanced foreign economies followed the yields on comparable maturity United States Treasury securities higher, and volatility in sovereign bond markets rose, particularly in Japan.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","id":84},{"text":" Private nonfarm employment rose moderately in April and May, while total government employment continued to decline somewhat.  Conditions in domestic and offshore dollar funding markets were generally little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Market based measures of inflation expectations decreased over the intermeeting period but remained within their ranges over the past few years.","id":84},{"text":" The labor force participation rate edged up in May, but was still slightly below its first quarter average, and the employment to population ratio increased a bit in recent months.  The monetary base grew at an annual rate exceeding 40 percent over the same period, driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances that resulted from the Federal Reserve s asset purchases.","id":84},{"text":" Forward looking indicators of near term labor market activity were mixed but generally pointed to some further improvement in labor market conditions in the coming months Household expectations of the labor market situation improved; initial claims for unemployment insurance were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period; and firms hiring plans edged up.  Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would hold roughly steady in the coming months, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, were generally at subdued levels that pointed to only modest increases in factory output in the near term.  The staff also continued to forecast that real GDP would accelerate gradually in 2014 and 2015, supported by accommodative monetary policy, an eventual easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, and further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions.  Some pointed out that the rate of hiring still fell short of the pace that they saw as consistent with more noticeable progress in labor market conditions, that a portion of the improvement in payroll employment since the September meeting was due to data revisions, or that there were no signs of an increase in wage pressures.  In their discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period, participants weighed the extent to which the rise in market interest rates and increase in volatility reflected a reassessment of market participants expectations for monetary policy and the extent to which it reflected growing confidence about the economic outlook.  Importantly, participants wanted to emphasize that the pace, composition, and extent of asset purchases would continue to be dependent on the Committee s assessment of the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, as well as the cumulative progress toward the Committee s economic objectives since the institution of the program last September.  Since the September meeting, some participants had become more confident of sustained improvement in the outlook for the labor market and so thought that a downward adjustment in asset purchases had or would likely soon become appropriate; they saw a need to clearly communicate an intention to lower the pace of purchases before long.  He would also draw the distinction between the asset purchase program and the forward guidance regarding the target for the federal funds rate, noting that the Committee anticipates that there will be a considerable time between the end of asset purchases and the time when it becomes appropriate to increase the target for the federal funds rate.  At the conclusion of its discussion, the Committee decided to continue adding policy accommodation by purchasing additional MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and to maintain its existing reinvestment policies.","id":84},{"text":" Conditions in the housing sector generally improved further, but construction activity was still at a relatively low level, and demand continued to be restrained by tight credit standards for mortgage loans.  Market sentiment toward large domestic banking organizations appeared to improve somewhat over the intermeeting period, likely related in part to further reductions in nonperforming loans and growing confidence in the economic outlook.  Spreads of yields on Italian and Spanish government debt over yields on German bunds increased only a few basis points, while comparable spreads for Greek sovereign debt declined notably.  Many participants saw the downside risks to the medium run outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished somewhat in recent months, or expressed greater confidence that stronger economic activity was in train.  Housing markets continued to strengthen, with participants variously reporting increases in house prices, sales, and building permits; low inventories of homes on the market; and rising demand for construction supplies.  In the view of one member, the improvement in the outlook for the labor market warranted a more deliberate statement from the Committee that asset purchases would be reduced in the very near future.","id":84},{"text":" Meanwhile, the issuance of syndicated leveraged loans remained robust in April and May, supported by strong investor demand for floating rate corporate debt instruments.  The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually.  However, the recent increase in mortgage purchase applications was seen as suggesting that the demand for housing was being driven by factors beyond low mortgage rates.  In particular, one pointed out that the furloughs scheduled for the second half of the year were likely to reduce household income and spending.  One participant expressed concern about the risk of a more rapid rise in inflation over the medium term, given the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  In addition, he would make clear that decisions about asset purchases and other policy tools would continue to be dependent on the Committee s ongoing assessment of the economic outlook.  Some added that they would, as well, need to see more evidence that the projected acceleration in economic activity would occur, before reducing the pace of asset purchases.  Another member pointed out that if the program were ended because of concerns about such consequences, the Committee would need to explore other options for providing appropriate monetary accommodation.","id":84},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the April 30 May 1 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first quarter.  Home prices continued to rise through February, and sales of new homes rose in March, but sales of existing homes decreased a little.  Over time, the supply of homes for sale was expected to increase as new construction picked up and sellers saw more attractive opportunities to put their houses on the market.","id":85},{"text":" The labor force participation rate also edged down to below its fourth quarter average.  Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the coming months would be a bit below that in March.  Conditions in the housing sector continued to improve, as real expenditures for residential investment expanded briskly in the first quarter, although from a low level.  Real business spending for nonresidential construction declined a little in the first quarter.  Real inventory investment increased in the first quarter, and business inventories in most industries appeared to be broadly aligned with sales in recent months.  Consumer energy prices declined in March, and retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of April.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial conditions improved a little, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Yields on corporate bonds fell roughly in line with those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, generally leaving their spreads little changed.  Gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms was solid over the same period.  CRE prices continued to move up slowly, and price indexes for various market segments reached levels last seen in late 2008.  Consumer credit continued to expand in January and February, mostly driven by sizable increases in nonrevolving credit.  Spending by consumers continued to expand, supported by better credit conditions, rising equity and housing prices, and lower energy prices; and the housing sector improved further.  However, growth in business investment spending slowed somewhat, and fiscal policy appeared to be exerting significant near term restraint on the economy.  Participants generally saw signs of improvement in labor market conditions despite the weaker than expected March payroll employment figure.  Businesses were reportedly still borrowing to refinance, but they had begun to take out more new loans as well.  Participants also touched on the conditions under which it might be appropriate to change the pace of asset purchases.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy was restraining economic growth.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.","id":85},{"text":" Broad indicators of manufacturing production, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that pointed to small increases in factory output in the near term.  In contrast, consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers was roughly flat, on balance, in March and April and remained relatively downbeat.  Real federal government purchases declined markedly in the first quarter, led by a significant decrease in defense spending, which may have partially reflected the anticipated effects of the federal spending sequestration.  Meanwhile, the monetary base expanded briskly over those two months, driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve s asset purchases.  By contrast, stock prices in Japan rose sharply, as the Bank of Japan surprised investors with the scale of its new monetary policy program aimed at raising inflation to 2 percent.  With fiscal policy expected to be tighter this year than last year, the staff still anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP would only somewhat exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013.  Participants continued to anticipate that, with appropriate monetary policy, growth would proceed at a moderate pace over the medium run and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels consistent with the Committee s mandate.  Reports included some weakening in manufacturing activity, due in part to reduced demand from abroad, and farm exports in one District were projected to be flat following strong growth in previous years.  Participants differed somewhat in their assessments of the magnitude of these effects on the economy, with views ranging from an estimate of substantial fiscal drag to one of less restraint than previously expected.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","id":85},{"text":" For example, real disposable income increased in February and March, supported in part by recent declines in retail gasoline prices that raised household purchasing power and offset to some extent the effects of this year s higher payroll and income taxes.  Yields of longer term Treasury securities and foreign benchmark sovereign bonds declined appreciably, reflecting the somewhat negative tone of United States and foreign economic data releases as well as policy actions by the Bank of Japan that were more accommodative than the markets had expected.  However, the Desk s survey of primary dealers, conducted prior to the April 30 May 1 meeting, indicated that the dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time for the initial increase in the target federal funds rate.  The median dealer anticipated that the FOMC would maintain its current pace of asset purchases through December 2013 and saw the second quarter of 2014 as the most probable time for the end of asset purchases, implying a slight upward revision to the projected total size of the Federal Reserve s asset purchase program.  Over the intermeeting period, near term measures of inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities moved lower amid somewhat disappointing economic data and declines in energy and other commodity prices; forward measures of inflation compensation changed little at longer horizons.  Early in the intermeeting period, prices of a range of risky assets abroad fell in reaction to reports of the bail in of depositors at banks in Cyprus and the imposition of an extended bank holiday in that country, but outside of Cyprus those movements generally proved temporary.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation, meeting participants generally indicated that they viewed the information received during the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace despite some softness in recent economic data.  More all cash or investor purchases were being reported, and the pace of home purchases overall appeared to be constrained less by a lack of demand than by a lack of homes for sale, in part reflecting fewer newly foreclosed houses coming onto the market.  Most observed that the outlook for the labor market had shown progress since the program was started in September, but many of these participants indicated that continued progress, more confidence in the outlook, or diminished downside risks would be required before slowing the pace of purchases would become appropriate.  The Committee agreed to continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and purchases of longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, as well as to maintain the Committee s reinvestment policies.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":85},{"text":" Both starts and permits of new single family homes increased, on net, over January and February.  Sales of both new and existing homes advanced in January, and home prices increased further.  Business inventories in most industries appeared to be generally aligned with sales in recent months.  Exports of capital goods increased; the other major categories of exports remained about unchanged.  Consumer food prices were flat in January and only edged up in February.  Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities edged down over the period.  The February Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated some easing in loan pricing.  Movements in the currencies of EMEs against the dollar were generally small.  In contrast, participants thought that fiscal policy was exerting significant near term restraint on the economy.  Participants generally saw conditions in the housing market as having improved further over the intermeeting period.  Investment spending on productivity enhancing technology was strong, as was pipeline construction in the energy sector.  Household spending and business fixed investment had advanced, and the housing sector had strengthened further, but fiscal policy had become somewhat more restrictive.  Two members indicated that purchases might well continue at the current pace at least through the end of the year.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.","id":86},{"text":" Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels that pointed to moderate increases in factory production in the near term.  Recent data for European economies, including retail sales and purchasing managers indexes, suggest that the rate of economic contraction may have diminished since the beginning of the year.  The staff surveyed a wide range of asset markets and financial institutions for signs of excess valuations, leverage, or risk taking that could pose systemic risks.","id":86},{"text":" Some key factors that tend to influence household spending were mixed Households real disposable incomes declined in January, reflecting in part the increases in both payroll and income taxes that went into effect at the beginning of the year and the previous pulling forward of taxable income from 2013 into 2012; in contrast, household net worth likely rose in recent months as a result of higher equity values and home prices.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Generally favorable United States economic data releases, along with communications from Federal Reserve policymakers regarding the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, appeared to contribute to improved sentiment in domestic financial markets over the intermeeting period despite some renewed concerns about economic and financial conditions in Europe.  Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases.  The staff s medium term forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, on balance, as the effects of somewhat more fiscal policy restraint and a higher assumed path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar were essentially offset by a brighter outlook for domestic energy production and a higher projection for household wealth, which reflected upward revisions to the projected paths for both equity prices and home prices.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant s judgment of appropriate monetary policy.  Meeting participants generally indicated that they viewed the economic data received during the intermeeting period as somewhat more positive than had been expected, but that fiscal policy appeared to have become more restrictive, leaving the outlook for the economy little changed on balance since the January meeting.  A couple of participants noted that the increase in the payroll tax appeared to have not yet had a material effect on household spending; however, another suggested that the payroll tax increase, along with higher gasoline prices, may be one reason why spending by lower income households appeared to be depressed, as those changes disproportionately cut into the disposable income of those households.  Meeting participants generally agreed that there was an ongoing need to evaluate the possible interactions between monetary policy decisions and financial stability, with some noting that adverse shocks to financial stability can affect progress toward the Committee s dual mandate.  Review of Efficacy and Costs of Asset Purchases The staff provided presentations covering the efficacy of the Federal Reserve s asset purchases, the effects of the purchases on security market functioning, the ways in which asset purchases might amplify or reduce risks to financial stability, and the fiscal implications of purchases.  Other participants, however, saw little evidence that the efficacy of asset purchases had declined over time, and a couple of these suggested that the effectiveness of purchases might even have increased more recently, as the easing of credit constraints allowed more borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates.  A few participants felt that MBS purchases provided more support to the economy than purchases of longer term Treasury securities because they stimulated the housing sector directly; however, a few preferred to focus any purchases in the Treasury market to avoid allocating credit to a specific sector of the economy.  Several participants suggested that enhanced supervision could serve to limit, at least to some extent, the increased risk taking associated with a lengthy period of low long term interest rates, and that effective policy communication or balance sheet management by the Committee could reduce the probability of excessively rapid increases in longer term rates.  It was also noted that the accommodative stance of policy could be supporting financial stability by returning the economy to a stable footing sooner than would otherwise be the case and perhaps by allowing borrowers to secure longer term financing and thereby reduce funding risks; by contrast, curtailing asset purchases could slow the recovery and so extend the period of very low interest rates.  In any case, it was indicated that the fiscal benefits of a stronger economy would be much greater than any short term fluctuations in remittances, and moreover, a couple of participants noted that cumulative remittances to the Treasury would likely be higher than would have been the case without any asset purchases.  Many participants, including some of those who were focused on the increasing risks, expressed the view that continued solid improvement in the outlook for the labor market could prompt the Committee to slow the pace of purchases beginning at some point over the next several meetings, while a few participants suggested that economic conditions would likely justify continuing the program at its current pace at least until late in the year.  Many participants emphasized that any decision to reduce the pace of purchases should reflect both an improvement in their overall outlook for labor market conditions, as implied by a wide range of available indicators, and their confidence in the sustainability of that improvement.  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as little changed since the previous meeting, and, consequently, all but one member judged that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to foster a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.  The Committee agreed that it would be appropriate to continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and purchases of longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, as well as to maintain the Committee s reinvestment policies.  In light of this discussion, the Committee included language in the statement to be released following the meeting in part to make explicit that the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases were conditional not only on the likely efficacy and costs of those purchases, but also on the extent of progress toward the Committee s economic objectives.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee s 2 percent longer run goal, and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.","id":86},{"text":" Pointing to academic and Federal Reserve staff research, most participants saw asset purchases as having a meaningful effect in easing financial conditions and so supporting economic growth.  Some expressed the view that these effects had likely been stronger during the Federal Reserve s initial large scale asset purchases because that program also helped support market functioning during the financial crisis.  Several others thought that if the outlook for labor market conditions improved as anticipated, it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and to stop them by year end.","id":86},{"text":" The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by market quotes moved down over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting policymakers communications that reinforced market expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation.  The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.  Most participants remarked on the federal spending sequester and its potential effects on the economy; they judged that recent tax and spending changes were already restraining aggregate demand or would do so over the course of the year.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","id":86},{"text":" The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":86},{"text":" Some observers have suggested that a lengthy period of low long term rates could encourage excessive risk taking that could have adverse consequences for financial stability at some point in the future.  In general, reflecting the limited experience with large scale asset purchases, participants recognized that estimates of the economic effects were necessarily imprecise and covered a wide range.  In light of their discussion of the benefits and costs of asset purchases, participants discussed their views on the appropriate course for the current asset purchase program.  A couple of these participants noted that if progress toward the Committee s economic goals were not maintained, the pace of purchases might appropriately be increased.  In light of the current review of benefits and costs, one member judged that the pace of purchases should ideally be slowed immediately.","id":86},{"text":" The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.  Consistent with Committee practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph.  The Committee voted unanimously to amend the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations, and to reaffirm the Foreign Currency Directive in the form shown below.  The Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations were amended to include the authority to conduct small value operations against the full range of foreign transactions that the Desk is authorized to conduct.  This change was made to allow for prudent testing of operational readiness, and is similar in purpose to the amendment that the Committee approved in June 2012 to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.  To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.  Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated as Macaulay duration).  Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for the United States dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, Section 1.  Mister Tarullo abstained because he did not think the statement had advanced the cause of achieving or communicating greater consensus in the policy views of the Committee.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.  By unanimous vote, the Rules of Procedure were amended to change the quorum requirements to state that a meeting of the FOMC could not be convened without a representative of a Reserve Bank.  Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets as well as the System open market operations during the period since the FOMC met on December 11 12, 2012.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  The rate of private sector hiring, along with indicators of job openings and firms hiring plans, was generally muted but remained consistent with continued moderate increases in employment in the coming months.  As a result, factory output expanded only slightly in the fourth quarter as a whole, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was only a little higher in December than in the third quarter.  The production of motor vehicles and parts increased considerably in the fourth quarter, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector declined somewhat.  Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the first quarter would be roughly the same as in the fourth quarter.  Increases in real personal consumption expenditures picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter, boosted importantly by higher spending on motor vehicles.  After being roughly flat in the third quarter, households real disposable income rose considerably, in part reflecting an acceleration of income payments in anticipation of increases in individual income tax rates after the turn of the year.  In the fourth quarter, sales of both new and existing homes were higher than in the previous quarter.  Real business spending for nonresidential construction declined somewhat in the fourth quarter and remained at a relatively low level.  Real federal government purchases decreased substantially in the fourth quarter, primarily because of a sharp decline in defense spending that followed a marked increase in the previous quarter.  The rise in imports was fairly broad based, led by strong increases in consumer goods, while the increase in exports mainly reflected higher sales of capital goods and automotive products.  Consumer energy prices declined in November and December, and survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices fell further in the first few weeks of January.  Consumer food prices continued to rise at a faster pace in November and December than in the third quarter, likely reflecting the ongoing effects of last summer s drought.  The expected path of the federal funds rate based on market quotes moved up on balance over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting a somewhat more positive assessment of the economic outlook.  Results from the Desk s survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the January meeting showed that dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate.  Treasury coupon yields increased over the intermeeting period, including a notable rise just after year end when passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 apparently lessened concerns about the risk of substantially higher fiscal drag on growth in the near term.  Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities rose slightly over the intermeeting period.  A broad index of bank stock prices rose, and the median spread on credit default swaps of the largest banking organizations moved lower.  Broad United States equity price indexes increased on net over the intermeeting period, buoyed by many of the same factors that contributed to the rise in Treasury yields.  Yields on speculative grade corporate bonds decreased over the intermeeting period, and yields on investment grade corporate bonds were up a bit.  The pace of gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms remained solid in the fourth quarter, but it was subdued in January, likely because of seasonal factors.  However, issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities strengthened during the fourth quarter, and spreads on those securities narrowed over the intermeeting period.  Growth of bank credit in the fourth quarter slowed to about half its pace compared with earlier in the year, as loan growth declined.  According to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic banks continued to ease somewhat their lending standards and some loan terms, on balance; they also experienced an increase in demand, on net, in most major loan categories in the fourth quarter.  Initial data suggested that the expiration of unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest bearing transaction accounts at year end had only a limited effect on bank deposits through early January.  Foreign financial conditions improved over the intermeeting period as markets responded favorably to the passage of fiscal policy legislation in the United States and to further progress in addressing euro area strains.  With fiscal policy still anticipated to be tighter this year than last year, the staff expected that increases in real GDP would only moderately exceed the growth rate of potential output.  Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up.  Participants remarked on the ongoing recovery in the housing market, pointing variously to rising house prices, growth in residential construction and sales, and the lower inventory of homes for sale.  A number of participants thought it likely that higher home values and low mortgage rates were helping support other sectors of the economy as well, and a couple saw the housing market as having the potential to cause overall growth to be stronger than expected this year.  Nonetheless, it was noted that mortgage credit remained tight and the fraction of homeowners with mortgage balances exceeding the value of their homes remained high.  Moreover, it was noted that businesses were in a good position to expand once they came to view the economic environment as more favorable.  In agriculture, record payouts from crop insurance following last year s drought supported farm incomes, and land prices continued to rise.  Reports on business conditions in the commercial real estate sector were more mixed but, on the whole, somewhat improved.  The strength of exports reportedly varied, with indications of higher demand from Mexico but some relatively pessimistic readings from firms about business conditions in Europe.  Participants generally welcomed an apparent pickup in economic growth in parts of Asia and saw reduced risk that the Chinese economy would slow abruptly, but it was noted that no economy was currently in a position to lead global growth higher.  Participants generally agreed that fiscal negotiations could develop in a way that would result in significantly greater drag on economic growth than in their baseline outlook.  One participant reported that firms in his District continued to have difficulty finding workers with suitable skills, suggesting that labor market mismatch was a factor deterring job growth.  Similarly, one participant cited empirical analysis showing that employment growth was lower in the states where a greater share of small businesses identified lack of demand as their most important business problem.  Several participants expressed concern that continuation of only slow job growth and persistently high long duration unemployment could lead to permanent damage to the labor market.  Participants generally saw recent price developments as consistent with their projections that inflation would remain at or below the Committee s 2 percent objective over the medium run.  Many of these participants worried that, should the economy continue to operate below potential for too long, reduced investment and underutilization of labor could further undermine the growth of potential output over time.  Some participants mentioned the potential for a sharp increase in longer term interest rates to adversely affect financial stability and indicated their interest in further work on this topic.  In addition, the Committee s highly accommodative policy was seen as helping keep inflation over the medium term closer to its longer run goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the case.  A few also raised concerns about the potential effects of further asset purchases on the functioning of particular financial markets, although a couple of other participants noted that there had been little evidence to date of such effects.  In light of this discussion, the staff was asked for additional analysis ahead of future meetings to support the Committee s ongoing assessment of the asset purchase program.  Several participants emphasized that the Committee should be prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in response to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation of the efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved.  For example, one participant argued that purchases should vary incrementally from meeting to meeting in response to incoming information about the economy.  A number of participants stated that an ongoing evaluation of the efficacy, costs, and risks of asset purchases might well lead the Committee to taper or end its purchases before it judged that a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market had occurred.  Several others argued that the potential costs of reducing or ending asset purchases too soon were also significant, or that asset purchases should continue until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook had occurred.  Members generally continued to anticipate that, with longer term inflation expectations stable and slack in resource utilization remaining, inflation over the medium term would run at or below the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent.  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members saw the economic outlook as relatively little changed since the previous meeting.  Some members remarked favorably on the move away from providing calendar dates in the forward guidance and toward highlighting the economic conditionality of future monetary policy.  In light of the importance of ongoing United States fiscal concerns, members discussed whether to include a reference to unresolved fiscal issues, but decided to refrain.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee s longer run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","id":87},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would rise somewhat in the coming months.  Probably reflecting those disruptions, sales of light motor vehicles fell in October but then increased notably in November.  Moreover, consumer sentiment fell back in early December to about its level during the summer.  Starts of new multifamily units rose in October, although permits declined somewhat following their brisk increase in the previous month.  Meanwhile, home prices advanced further and sales of existing homes continued to expand, but new home sales were little changed.  Real state and local government purchases were little changed in the third quarter.  The employment cost index rose only a bit faster than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period.  Market based measures of uncertainty about the path of the federal funds rate beyond the near term also declined.  Nevertheless, the credit default swap spreads of most large domestic bank holding companies continued to move lower.  Yields on speculative grade corporate bonds fell to historical lows, and their spreads decreased slightly.  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding increased somewhat in November following a small decline in October.  House prices continued to increase despite a rise in the proportion of properties sold through foreclosures or short sales.  The November Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated some easing in loan pricing and terms.  The Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchase program and announced a new lending scheme.  The Reserve Bank of Australia and several emerging market central banks also eased monetary policy.  Several pointed to indicators suggesting that rates of hiring remained depressed relative to those observed before the financial crisis.  Participants also discussed the implications of continued asset purchases for the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  Household spending had continued to advance and the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement, but growth in the business sector had slowed.  Inflation had been subdued, apart from some temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.","id":88},{"text":" Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased slightly over the year ending in the third quarter, and with a moderate rise in productivity, unit labor costs were essentially unchanged.  The expected path of the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swap rates flattened somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting period, as longer dated rates declined.  The survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the December meeting showed that they expected the FOMC to maintain purchases of longer term securities after year end at about the current pace of $85 billion per month.  Spreads on Greek sovereign bonds over comparable German bunds fell, on balance, reflecting in part the agreement by European officials and the International Monetary Fund to grant further aid to Greece.  The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to result in only a gradual decline in slack in labor and product markets over the forecast period, and progress in reducing unemployment was expected to be relatively slow.  In their discussion of the economic situation, participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace, apart from weather related disruptions.  Consumer price inflation had been running somewhat below the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent, apart from temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices, and longer term inflation expectations had remained stable.  Committee Policy Action Committee members viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, abstracting from weather related disruptions.  Members generally agreed that the economic outlook was little changed since the previous meeting and judged that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":88},{"text":" In their assessments of the economic outlook, many participants thought that the pace of economic expansion would remain moderate in 2013 before picking up gradually in 2014 and 2015.  In the agricultural sector, farm incomes were high, notwithstanding the drought, although elevated grain prices were cutting into profits on livestock.  A few participants noted that some exits from the labor force may have been related to the loss or prospective loss of eligibility for emergency unemployment insurance benefits.","id":88},{"text":" With crude oil prices expected to continue to decrease slowly, the boost to retail food prices from last summer s drought anticipated to be only temporary and fairly small, long run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and considerable resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff projected that inflation would be subdued through 2015.  Participants observed that growth in economic activity continued to be restrained by several persistent headwinds, including ongoing deleveraging on the part of households and still tight credit conditions for some borrowers, and that a major headwind facing the economy at present appeared to be uncertainty about United States fiscal policy and the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on federal spending and taxes.  Some participants noted that an early and constructive resolution to fiscal policy negotiations had the potential to release pent up demand and therefore be followed by a boost to spending, investment, and employment; however, a few pointed out that an extended breakdown of negotiations could have significant adverse effects on economic growth.  The Committee judged that such accommodation should be provided in part by continuing to purchase MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and by purchasing longer term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month, following the completion of the maturity extension program at the end of the year.","id":88},{"text":" In the syndicated leveraged loan market, issuance through the first three quarters of 2012 lagged that of the same period in 2011 but nonetheless remained solid.  The fraction of seriously delinquent existing mortgages remained elevated, but the rate at which mortgages entered delinquency continued to trend down in July.  Several participants questioned the effectiveness of the current purchases or whether a continuation of them would be warranted if the recent moderate pace of economic recovery were sustained.","id":89},{"text":"Thresholds and Forward Guidance A staff presentation focused on the potential effects of using specific threshold values of inflation and the unemployment rate to provide forward guidance regarding the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate.  Accordingly, thresholds could increase the probability that market reactions to economic developments would move longer term interest rates in a manner consistent with the Committee s view regarding the likely future path of short term rates.  Participants generally agreed that the Committee would need to resolve a number of practical issues before deciding whether to adopt quantitative thresholds to communicate its thinking about the timing of the initial increase in the federal funds rate.  Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013.  Moreover, many participants cited significant downside risks to the outlook that might arise from more widespread weakness in global economic activity or an intensification of strains in global financial markets.  The increase in consumer spending appeared to be relatively broadly based across the country, although retailers in a few areas reported that they had seen slower sales recently and expressed concerns about the near term outlook.  In their discussion of financial developments over the intermeeting period, participants commented on the effects of the policy actions taken at the September meeting to strengthen the Committee s forward guidance and to purchase additional MBS.  In particular, some pointed out that the favorable developments in mortgage markets over the intermeeting period suggested that the MBS purchases were likely to reinforce the nascent recovery in the housing market.  Looking ahead, a number of participants indicated that additional asset purchases would likely be appropriate next year after the conclusion of the maturity extension program in order to achieve a substantial improvement in the labor market.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage backed securities.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.","id":89},{"text":" It was noted that such guidance could have significant effects on financial conditions and the economy.  The initial effects were generally viewed as consistent with a marked easing in financial conditions.","id":89},{"text":" Participants also discussed the efficacy and potential costs of the Committee s asset purchases.","id":89},{"text":" Many participants were of the view that adopting quantitative thresholds could, under the right conditions, help the Committee more clearly communicate its thinking about how the likely timing of an eventual increase in the federal funds rate would shift in response to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and the outlook.  The somewhat better than expected crop harvest caused spot and futures prices of farm commodities to retrace some of their rise during the summer; however, farm commodity prices remained elevated and continued to point toward some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year.  The upward revision to the near term forecast primarily reflected better than expected incoming information for consumer spending, residential construction, and labor market conditions that more than offset the recent data for business fixed investment and industrial production that were weaker than anticipated.  A few participants observed that low interest rates had increased demand for riskier financial products, and a couple of participants saw a risk that holding interest rates low for a prolonged period could lead to financial imbalances and imprudent risk taking.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid 2015.","id":89},{"text":" Meeting participants discussed whether such thresholds might usefully replace or perhaps augment the date based guidance that had been provided in the policy statements since August 2011.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chairman asked the staff to provide additional background material, taking into account the range of participants views.  Sales of existing homes continued to expand, on balance, in recent months, but new home sales were flat.  Foreign economic growth remained sluggish, restrained by weak activity in Europe and the associated spillovers including through trade to the rest of the world.  However, toward the end of the period investor sentiment deteriorated somewhat, in part because of concerns about corporate profitability.  M2 growth picked up somewhat in September, as strong growth in liquid deposits and currency offset ongoing declines in small time deposits and retail money market funds.  However, with economic growth anticipated to stay moderate, some participants expressed concern that the pace of job creation would generate only a slow decline in joblessness.  Similarly, effects of the drought were expected to show through to retail food prices over the next few quarters but then subside.  The Committee also agreed to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into agency MBS.  With the economic outlook little changed, they agreed that the remainder of the statement would reiterate the policy actions and intentions adopted at the September meeting.","id":89},{"text":" Nominal business spending for new nonresidential construction decreased further in August.  State and local government payrolls expanded, but nominal construction spending continued to decline in recent months.  Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices, while longer run inflation expectations remained stable.  These participants also noted that underwriting standards remained quite tight, particularly for borrowers with lower credit quality.","id":89},{"text":" The survey of primary dealers conducted prior to the October meeting showed that the expected size of the SOMA at the end of 2013 had risen significantly.  In secured funding markets, rates on repurchase agreements spiked around quarter end but subsequently more than retraced that move, ending the intermeeting period down slightly.  Among the factors mentioned that might support consumer confidence and a continuation of the somewhat stronger pace of spending were an expected decline in retail energy prices and continued gradual improvement in labor market conditions.","id":89},{"text":" The longer run projections represent each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  However, participants also observed that significant risks related to the euro area banking and fiscal crisis remained, and that a number of important issues would have to be resolved in order to achieve further progress toward a comprehensive solution to the crisis.  It was noted that clear communication and credibility allow the central bank to help shape the public s expectations about policy, which is crucial to managing monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":90},{"text":" Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities edged up over the period but stayed in the ranges observed over recent quarters.  Spreads of shorter term yields on peripheral euro area sovereign bonds over those on comparable maturity German bunds declined substantially over the period.  Funding conditions for euro area banks improved, although these conditions remained fragile, and draws on the Federal Reserve s liquidity swap facility with the ECB fell.  Regarding the economic outlook, participants generally agreed that the pace of the economic recovery would likely remain moderate over coming quarters but would pick up over the 2013 15 period.  Participants discussed the effectiveness of purchases of Treasury securities relative to purchases of agency MBS in easing financial conditions.  Participants discussed the benefits of such an approach, including the potential for enhanced effectiveness of policy through greater clarity regarding the Committee s future behavior.","id":90},{"text":" Manufacturing production increased at a faster pace in July than in the second quarter, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization rose slightly.  Incoming data on factors that tend to support household spending were somewhat mixed.  Home prices increased for the sixth consecutive month in July, and sales of both new and existing homes also rose.  Nominal business spending for new nonresidential construction declined in July after only edging up in the second quarter.  Consumer energy prices declined slightly in July, but survey data indicated that retail gasoline prices rose in August.  The employment cost index increased a little more slowly than the measure of compensation per hour over the same period.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Sentiment in financial markets improved somewhat since the time of the August FOMC meeting.  Treasury yields subsequently rose further as concerns about the situation in the euro area moderated.  Conditions in unsecured short term dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  Net debt issuance by nonfinancial firms continued to be strong over the period.  Issuance of collateralized loan obligations remained on pace to post its strongest year since 2007.  Nevertheless, issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities continued at a solid pace over the intermeeting period.  Although consumer spending had continued to advance, growth in business fixed investment appeared to have slowed.  Reports on manufacturing activity were mixed, with production related to autos and housing the most notable areas of relative strength.  The drought was expected to reduce farm inventories and have a transitory impact on broader measures of economic growth.  In addition, the labor force participation rate and employment to population ratios were at or near post recession lows.  Meeting participants again discussed the extent of slack in labor markets.  Sentiment in financial markets improved notably during the intermeeting period.  Participants again exchanged views on the likely benefits and costs of a new large scale asset purchase program.  The possible adverse effects of large purchases on market functioning were also noted.  Participants also discussed issues related to the provision of forward guidance regarding the future path of the federal funds rate.  If the public interpreted the statement pessimistically, consumer and business confidence could fall rather than rise.  Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed.","id":90},{"text":" The rise in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector was muted over the year ending in the second quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.  Participants also noted that if an agreement was not reached to tackle the expiring tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions, a sharp consolidation of fiscal policy would take place at the beginning of 2013.","id":90},{"text":" Broad price indexes for United States equities rose moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period, prompted by generally better than expected readings on economic activity released early in the period, somewhat reduced concerns about the situation in Europe, and some additional anticipation of monetary policy easing later in the period.  Moreover, participants observed that the pace of economic recovery would likely continue to be held down for some time by persistent headwinds, including continued weakness in the housing market, ongoing household sector deleveraging, still tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal consolidation at all levels of government.  This flexible approach was seen as allowing the Committee to tailor its policy response over time to incoming information while incorporating conditional features that clarified the Committee s intention to improve labor market conditions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the action by helping to bolster business and consumer confidence.  One member dissented from the policy decision, on the grounds that he opposed additional asset purchases and preferred to omit the calendar date from the forward guidance; in his view, it would be better to use qualitative language to describe the factors that would influence the Committee s decision to increase the target federal funds rate.  These actions, which together will increase the Committee s holdings of longer term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid 2015.","id":90},{"text":" In addition to ongoing weakness in spending at the federal, state, and local government levels, uncertainties about tax and spending policies reportedly were restraining business decisionmaking.  Many participants indicated a preference for replacing the calendar date with language describing the economic factors that the Committee would consider in deciding to raise its target for the federal funds rate.  However, growth in employment had been slow, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee s mandate.","id":90},{"text":"Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the July 31 August 1 meeting indicated that economic activity increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and that labor market conditions had improved little in recent months.  Broader indicators of manufacturing output, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, declined in recent months and were at levels consistent with only muted increases in production in the near term.  The gradual expansion in total loans was broadly consistent with the July SLOOS, in which domestic banks generally indicated that demand strengthened for many types of loans in the second quarter and that lending standards eased somewhat, on balance, across most major loan categories.  Thereafter, economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by an eventual easing in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit conditions, and continued accommodative monetary policy.  In addition, some participants expressed concern about the persistent headwinds restraining the pace of the recovery, including the weak housing sector, still tight borrowing conditions for some households and firms, and fiscal restraint at all levels of government.  Although participants generally agreed that improvements in recent years in the capital and liquidity of financial institutions and in the strength of household and business balance sheets have increased the resilience of the economy, some were concerned that at its current pace, the recovery was still vulnerable to adverse shocks.  Although several participants noted that the uncertainty had not led businesses in their Districts to reduce payrolls or cut back spending, others cited reports of shortfalls from business plans that could lead to cost cutting, of restructuring to position firms for leaner operations, or even of postponed investment and hiring.  Financial markets remained sensitive to ongoing developments related to the sovereign debt and banking situation in the euro area, and participants continued to view the possibility of an intensification of strains in global financial markets as a significant downside risk to the domestic economic outlook.  One participant pointed out that credit risk spreads while still above pre recession norms may have been boosted by safe haven demands for Treasury securities and indicated that broader financial market conditions seemed reasonably accommodative.  It was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed.  Given the uncertainty attending the economic outlook, a few participants questioned whether the conditionality of the forward guidance was sufficiently clear, and they suggested that the Committee should consider replacing the calendar date with guidance that was linked more directly to the economic factors that the Committee would consider in deciding to raise its target for the federal funds rate, or omit the forward guidance language entirely.  In reviewing the costs that such a program might entail, some participants expressed concerns about the effects of additional asset purchases on trading conditions in markets related to Treasury securities and agency MBS, but others agreed with the staff s analysis showing substantial capacity for additional purchases without disrupting market functioning.  In light of the Bank of England s Funding for Lending Scheme, a couple of participants expressed interest in exploring possible programs aimed at encouraging bank lending to households and firms, although the importance of institutional differences between the two countries was noted.","id":91},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the third quarter would be about the same as in the second quarter.  Both starts and permits of new single family homes increased in the second quarter.  Real business spending for nonresidential construction increased somewhat in the second quarter but remained at a relatively low level.  Average hourly earnings for all employees also increased at a relatively slow rate last quarter.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Several factors influenced developments in financial markets since the time of the June FOMC meeting.  Interest rates generally moved down, on net, over the intermeeting period.  In secured funding markets, Treasury general collateral repurchase agreement rates rose slightly on balance.  Yields on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds fell further over the intermeeting period, approaching record lows.  Their spreads relative to comparable maturity Treasury securities narrowed but were still above their average levels prior to the financial crisis.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was anemic in June and July.  Conditions in the housing sector appeared to have improved somewhat, but from a very low level.  Meeting participants again exchanged views on the extent of slack in labor and product markets.  Nonetheless, forward looking surveys of orders and manufacturing production in a couple of Districts were more positive.  Energy related activity continued to expand, and investment projects in that sector were reported to be moving forward.  Nonetheless, participants generally agreed that conditions in domestic credit markets remained more favorable than they were a year ago.  Participants also exchanged views on the likely benefits and costs of a new large scale asset purchase program.  Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.","id":91},{"text":" Starts of new multifamily units were about the same last quarter as in the previous quarter, but permits rose, which pointed to higher multifamily construction in the coming months.  Other recent forward looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, also suggested that increases in outlays for business equipment would slow in coming months.  Stock prices for the large domestic bank holding companies posted mixed changes over the period, and credit default swap (CDS) spreads for those firms generally moved lower on net.  Issuance in the syndicated leveraged loan market remained solid in the second quarter; terms and structures of new leveraged loan deals reportedly loosened modestly on the margin.  Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, likely in part because of a compositional shift of credit supply over the past few years toward the least risky borrowers.  The Bank of England increased the size of its asset purchase program and announced details on its new program designed to boost bank lending to the nonfinancial sector.  With the restraint from fiscal policy assumed to increase next year, the staff projected that increases in real GDP would not significantly exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013.  However, some participants indicated that they had lowered their near term forecasts for economic growth in light of the weaker than expected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months.  Many participants reported that house prices in their Districts were rising or had bottomed out, and several noted that their contacts saw signs of progress in reducing the overhang of unsold properties.  Regarding the business sector, many participants reported that, with the exception of motor vehicle production, manufacturing activity in their Districts was slow or had declined in recent months.  One of the policy options discussed was an extension of the period over which the Committee expected to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  Many participants expected that such a program could provide additional support for the economic recovery both by putting downward pressure on longer term interest rates and by contributing to easier financial conditions more broadly.  Committee Policy Action The information received over the intermeeting period indicated that economic activity had decelerated in recent months, with a notable slowing in consumer spending.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.","id":91},{"text":" Meanwhile, the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization remained about the same as earlier in the year.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased solidly in the first quarter.  The estimated level of households real disposable income was revised down for the fourth quarter of last year.  Nominal business spending for nonresidential construction was essentially flat in April relative to the first quarter.  Yields on longer dated nominal and inflation protected Treasury securities moved down substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The staff s broad nominal dollar index ended the intermeeting period up moderately.  There were a number of reports of slowing sales to Europe and Asia.  Meeting participants again discussed the extent of slack in labor markets.  Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.","id":92},{"text":" Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the FOMC met on April 24 25, 2012.  Investors expectation that five large United States banks would have their credit ratings downgraded at the end of June, as part of rating agencies review of major financial institutions, may also have weighed on the equity prices of those banks.","id":92},{"text":" Meanwhile, inventories in most industries looked to be roughly aligned with sales in recent months.  The possibility that United States fiscal policy would be more contractionary than anticipated was also cited as a downside risk.  The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.","id":92},{"text":" However, strains in global financial markets, which stemmed primarily from fiscal and banking concerns in Europe, had become more pronounced over the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook; the possibility of a sharper than anticipated fiscal tightening in the United States also posed a downside risk.  Some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs, a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to participants estimates of its longer run normal level.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","id":92},{"text":" In recent months, the output of motor vehicles and parts increased further, on balance, although at a slower rate than in the first quarter, while factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector only inched up.  A sizable portion of the decline in longer term Treasury rates over the period appeared to reflect greater safe haven demands by investors, along with some increase in market participants expectations of further Federal Reserve balance sheet actions.  A few participants reported hearing that defense contractors were making contingency plans to reduce their workforces if potential spending cuts go into effect; one reported that some firms already had begun to make such reductions.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","id":92},{"text":" In particular, participants noted that while the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) provides information about their individual projections of key macroeconomic variables and about the path of monetary policy that each sees as appropriate and consistent with his or her projections, the SEP does not provide guidance about how those diverse views come together in the Committee s collective judgment about the outlook and appropriate policy as expressed in its postmeeting statement.  In light of their assessment of the economic situation, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","id":92},{"text":" Moreover, real disposable income rose at a subdued pace in the first quarter of this year, though it received some boost from lower energy prices in April.  Consumer credit expanded at a solid pace in recent months, as increases in student loans boosted nonrevolving credit while revolving credit was about flat.  Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, partly reflecting a shift in the composition of borrowers toward those with higher credit scores.  As in April, participants expected that most of the factors restraining economic expansion would ease over time, and so anticipated that the recovery eventually would gain strength.  One participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth.  Members also agreed to maintain the Committee s existing policy regarding the reinvestment of principal payments from Federal Reserve holdings of agency securities into agency MBS.  Members generally judged that continuing the maturity extension program would put some downward pressure on longer term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  Members again noted that the forward guidance is conditional on economic developments and that the date given in the statement would be subject to revision should there be a significant change in the economic outlook.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":92},{"text":" More recently, average hourly earnings for all employees edged up in April and May, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier continued to be slow.  More broadly, improving household balance sheets and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as likely to help support rising household expenditures over time.","id":92},{"text":" Data for federal government spending in April and May pointed to a slower pace of decline in defense outlays in the second quarter.  Business fixed investment had continued to advance, and household spending appeared to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  A few participants expressed concern that slow growth in employment and low levels of consumer confidence would further restrain consumer spending.  Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services.","id":92},{"text":" Overall consumer price inflation increased somewhat, primarily reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline, but measures of long run inflation expectations remained stable.  Broad United States stock price indexes followed the general pattern observed across asset markets, rising early in the period on increased investor optimism and then falling later on, to end the period little changed on net.  Yields and spreads on investment grade corporate bonds were about unchanged, but yields and spreads on speculative grade corporate bonds increased somewhat.  In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee s previous meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand moderately.  Many United States financial institutions had been taking steps to bolster their resiliency, including increasing capital levels and liquidity buffers, and reducing their European exposures.  The Committee also discussed the relationship between the Committee s statement, which expresses the collective view of the Committee, and the policy projections of individual participants, which are included in the SEP.","id":93},{"text":" A number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, slow household income growth, and notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement ongoing weakness in the housing market.  Looking forward, increases in household wealth from the rise in equity prices, improving consumer sentiment, and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as helping to support continued increases in household expenditures, notwithstanding sluggish growth in real disposable income and restrictive fiscal policies.  With the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all of the members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policies of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion.","id":93},{"text":" Moreover, sales of new and existing homes edged down, on net, in recent months.  In contrast, nominal business spending for nonresidential construction declined in January and February.  Inventories in most industries looked to be fairly well aligned with sales in recent months, although motor vehicle stocks were still relatively lean.  Exports of goods declined largely because of a decrease in exports of automotive products.  In March, prices measured by the consumer price index increased at that same faster pace.  Meanwhile, increases in consumer food prices were relatively subdued in recent months.  Available measures of labor compensation indicated that nominal wage gains continued to be muted.  Businesses continued to raise substantial amounts of funds in credit and capital markets over recent months.  With respect to credit to households, developments over the intermeeting period were mixed.  Bank credit slowed in March but expanded at a solid pace in the first quarter as a whole.  Household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand.  House prices appeared to be stabilizing but had not yet begun to rise in most markets.  Several participants indicated that uncertainty about the trajectory of future fiscal policy could lead businesses to defer hiring and investment.  Contacts in some parts of the country said that highly qualified workers were in short supply; overall, however, wage pressures had been limited so far.  Bank credit quality and consumer and business loan demand were increasing, although commercial and residential real estate lending remained relatively weak.  Participants expected that global financial markets would remain focused on the evolving situation in Europe.  Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":93},{"text":" The vote to renew the System s participation in these swap arrangements was taken at this meeting because a provision in the Framework Agreement requires each party to provide six months prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  Real state and local government purchases appeared to be about flat last quarter, as the payrolls of these governments edged up in the first quarter and their nominal construction spending declined slightly, on net, in January and February.  Leveraged loan issuance was brisk over this period as well, reportedly supported by investor demand for newly issued collateralized loan obligations as well as by interest from pension funds and other institutional investors.  The staff s broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting period as the dollar appreciated against most emerging market currencies but depreciated moderately against the yen and sterling.  Increases in economic activity were expected to be sufficient to decrease the wide margin of slack in the labor market slowly over the projection period, but the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014.  Another posited that the strength in payroll job growth in recent months may be a one time reaction to the sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009 and that future job gains may be somewhat weaker unless the pace of economic growth increases.","id":93},{"text":" On net, nominal Treasury yields finished the period slightly lower and measures of the expected path for the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swap (OIS) rates moved down.  A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns.  In recent weeks, oil prices had begun to fall and readings from the oil futures market suggested this may continue; non energy commodity prices had remained relatively stable.","id":93},{"text":" Participants continued to expect most of the factors restraining economic expansion to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength.  Most members continued to anticipate that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer run level, and inflation would be at or below the Committee s longer run objective, in late 2014.","id":93},{"text":" Increases in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector picked up somewhat over the four quarters of 2011.  Longer term inflation expectations had remained stable, and most meeting participants saw little evidence of cost pressures.  In the retail sector, sales of new autos had strengthened, but reports from other retailers were mixed.  Strains in global financial markets have eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.","id":94},{"text":" Issuance of consumer credit asset backed securities remained at moderate levels in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in early 2012.  Meanwhile, spreads on credit default swaps for debt issued by states were roughly flat over the intermeeting period.  In this view, the recent pace of employment gains might not be sustained if the growth rate of spending did not pick up.  To further its long run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  Labor market conditions have improved further; the unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":94},{"text":" Financial conditions had improved notably since the January meeting Equity prices were higher and risk spreads had declined.  Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months.  Participants saw the possibility of disruptions in global financial markets as continuing to pose a risk to growth.","id":94},{"text":" Data through December indicated that net exports made a moderate negative contribution to the rate of growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of last year.  In addition, spreads of rates on asset backed commercial paper over those on AA rated nonfinancial paper decreased significantly, and the amounts outstanding from programs with European sponsors remained stable.  Financing conditions in the commercial real estate sector continued to be tight, and issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities remained low in the fourth quarter of last year.  Participants continued to expect most of the factors restraining economic expansion to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength.","id":94},{"text":" Meanwhile, increases in consumer food prices slowed in recent months.  The aggregate credit quality of loans on banks books continued to improve across most asset classes in the fourth quarter.  Participants generally observed the continued improvement in labor market conditions since the January meeting.","id":94},{"text":" After increasing in December, starts of new single family homes remained at that higher level in January, likely boosted in part by unseasonably warm weather; in both months, starts ran above permit issuance.  Funding conditions for euro area banks eased over the period, as the European Central Bank (ECB) conducted its second three year refinancing operation and widened the pool of eligible collateral for refinancing operations.  A number of participants observed that exports continued to be a positive factor for United States growth, while noting risks to the export picture from economic weakness in Europe or a greater than expected slowdown in China and emerging Asia.  Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing.  With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that only relatively small modifications to the first two paragraphs were needed to reflect the incoming economic data, the improvement in financial conditions, and the modest changes to the economic outlook.","id":94},{"text":" The staff also revised up its forecast for inflation a bit compared with the projection prepared for the January FOMC meeting, reflecting recent data indicating higher paths for the prices of oil, other commodities, and imports, along with a somewhat narrower margin of economic slack in the March forecast.  While a few participants suggested that recent improvements in labor market conditions and the easing in financial conditions could help lay the groundwork for a strengthening in the pace of household spending, several other participants pointed to factors that would likely restrain consumption Growth in real disposable income was still sluggish, and consumer sentiment, despite some improvement since last summer, remained weak.  A number of participants viewed the recent run up in petroleum prices as likely to limit gains in consumer spending on non energy items for a time; a couple of participants noted, however, that the unseasonably warm weather and the declining price of natural gas had helped cushion the effect of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers overall energy bills.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","id":94},{"text":" Demand for securities financing was reported to have risen somewhat across asset types, but dealers indicated that the risk appetite of most clients had changed relatively little over the previous three months.  In particular, the Bank of England increased the size of its existing gilt purchase program in February, and the Bank of Japan scaled up its Asset Purchase Program.  A couple of members indicated that the initiation of additional stimulus could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below its mandate consistent rate of 2 percent over the medium run.","id":94},{"text":" The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee A.  Mister Lacker dissented in the votes on the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive to indicate his opposition to foreign currency intervention by the Federal Reserve.  To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.  In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee.

Any operation that would result in a change in the System s overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy Following the Committee s disposition of organizational matters, participants considered a revised draft of a statement of principles regarding the FOMC s longer run goals and monetary policy strategy.  The revisions reflected discussion of an earlier draft during the Committee s December meeting as well as comments received over the intermeeting period.  The Chairman noted that the proposed statement did not represent a change in the Committee s policy approach.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on December 13, 2011.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the January 24 25 meeting indicated that United States economic activity continued to expand moderately, while global growth appeared to be slowing.  Industrial production expanded in November and December, on net, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization moved up.  Real personal consumption expenditures continued to rise moderately in November, boosted by spending for motor vehicles and other durables, although households real disposable income edged down.  In December, however, nominal retail sales excluding purchases at motor vehicle and parts outlets declined, and sales of motor vehicles also dropped slightly.  Forward looking indicators of firms equipment spending were mixed Some survey measures of business conditions and capital spending plans improved, but corporate bond spreads continued to be elevated and analysts earnings expectations for producers of capital goods remained muted.  Inventories in most industries looked to be well aligned with sales, though motor vehicle stocks remained lean.  Monthly data for federal government spending pointed to a significant decline in real defense purchases in the fourth quarter.  Real state and local government purchases seemed to be decreasing at a slower rate than during earlier quarters, as the pace of reductions in payrolls eased and construction spending leveled off in recent months.  The rise in imports largely reflected higher imports of petroleum products and automotive products, which more than offset decreases in most other broad categories of imports.  Overall United States consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures were unchanged in November; as measured by the consumer price index, they were flat in December as well.  Average hourly earnings for all employees posted a moderate gain in December, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier remained slow.  In the euro area, retail sales and industrial production were below their third quarter averages in both October and November.  Twelve month inflation rates receded in several advanced and emerging market economies, and most central banks maintained policy rates or eased further while continuing to provide significant liquidity support.  U.S. financial institutions reportedly retained ready access to short term funding markets; there were no significant dislocations in those markets over year end.  In secured funding markets, spreads of overnight asset backed CP rates over overnight unsecured CP rates also declined, and the general collateral repurchase agreement, or repo, market continued to function normally.  Market based measures of possible spillovers from troubles at particular financial firms to the broader financial system were below their levels in the fall but remained above their levels prior to the financial crisis.  Although credit default swap (CDS) spreads of most large domestic bank holding companies remained elevated, they moved lower over the intermeeting period, and some institutions took advantage of easing credit conditions by issuing significant quantities of new long term debt.  Responses to the December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms indicate that, since August, securities dealers have devoted increased time and attention to the management of concentrated credit exposures to other financial intermediaries, pointing to increased concern over counterparty risk.  Bond issuance by investment grade nonfinancial corporations was robust, though below its elevated November pace, while issuance by lower rated firms slowed, likely owing in part to seasonal factors.  Share repurchases and cash financed mergers by nonfinancial firms maintained their recent strength in the third quarter, leaving net equity issuance deeply negative.  Responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that bank CRE lending standards continued to be extraordinarily tight, but some banks reported having reduced the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds (compared with a year ago) for the first time since 2007.  Mortgage delinquency rates, while improving gradually, remained elevated relative to pre crisis norms, and house prices continued to move lower.  The price of subprime residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), as measured by the ABX index, rose over the intermeeting period, consistent with similar changes for other higher risk fixed income securities.  Consumer credit increased in November, while delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools held steady in November at historically low levels.  Responses to the January SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, loan demand strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit further in the fourth quarter.  In addition, demand deposits rose rapidly around year end, reportedly because lenders in short term funding markets chose to leave substantial balances with banks over the turn of the year.  International financial markets seemed somewhat calmer over the intermeeting period than they had been in previous months, and the funding conditions faced by most European financial institutions and sovereigns eased somewhat in the wake of the ECB s first three year LTRO.  Short term euro interest rates moved lower as euro area institutions drew a substantial amount of three year funds from the ECB, and dollar funding costs for European banks also appeared to decline.  Spreads of yields on Italian and Spanish government debt over those on German bunds narrowed over the intermeeting period, with spreads on shorter term debt falling particularly noticeably.  The staff s broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  The revision reflected the apparent decline in federal defense purchases and the somewhat shallower trajectory for consumer spending in recent months; the recent data on the labor market, production, and other spending categories were, on balance, roughly in line with the staff s expectations at the time of the previous forecast.  Household spending had continued to advance at a moderate pace despite still sluggish growth in real disposable income, but growth in business fixed investment had slowed.  Many participants observed that some indicators bearing on the economy s recent performance had shown greater than expected improvement, but a number also noted less favorable data; one noted that growth in final sales appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter of last year even as output growth picked up.  Participants continued to expect these headwinds to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength.  In discussing the household sector, meeting participants noted that consumer spending had grown moderately in recent months.  Business contacts in the retail sector reported generally satisfactory holiday sales, but high end retailers saw strong gains while lower end retailers saw mixed results.  Nonetheless, business contacts had become somewhat more optimistic, with more contacts reporting plans to expand capacity and payrolls.  A few participants noted that national and District surveys of firms capital spending plans suggested that the recent slowing in business fixed investment was partly temporary.  The combination of high energy prices and availability of new drilling technologies was promoting strong growth in investment outlays in the energy sector.  The level of activity remained quite weak, house prices were continuing to decline in most areas, and the overhang of foreclosed and distressed properties was still substantial.  The inventory of unsold homes had declined, though in part because the foreclosure process had slowed, and issuance of permits for new single family homes had risen from its lows.  One participant again noted reports from some homebuilders suggesting that land prices were edging up and that financing was available from nonbank sources.  Another participant cited reports from business contacts indicating that credit standards in mortgage lending were becoming somewhat less stringent.  Participants generally expected that growth of United States exports was likely to be held back in the coming year by slower global economic growth.  In particular, fiscal austerity programs in Europe and stresses in the European banking system seemed likely to restrain economic growth there, perhaps with some spillover to growth in Asia.  Participants agreed that recent indicators showed some further gradual improvement in overall labor market conditions Payroll employment had increased somewhat more rapidly in recent months, new claims for unemployment insurance had trended lower, and the unemployment rate had declined.  Participants expressed a range of views on the current extent of slack in the labor market.  Meeting participants observed that financial conditions improved and financial market stresses eased somewhat during the intermeeting period Equity prices rose, volatility declined, and bank lending conditions appeared to improve.  Participants noted that the ECB s three year refinancing operation had apparently contributed to improved conditions in European sovereign debt markets.  Nonetheless, participants expected that global financial markets would remain focused on the evolving situation in Europe and anticipated that continued policy efforts would be necessary in Europe to fully address the area s fiscal and financial problems.  United States banks reported increases in commercial lending as some European lenders pulled back, and some banking contacts indicated that creditworthy companies demand for credit had increased.  One participant reported that a survey of business inflation expectations indicated firms were anticipating increases in unit costs on the order of 1 3/4 percent this year, just a bit higher than last year.  Many participants thought it important to explore means for better communicating policymakers thinking about future monetary policy and its relationship to evolving economic conditions.  Different opinions were expressed regarding the appropriate values of such thresholds, reflecting different assessments of the path for the federal funds rate that would likely be appropriate to foster the Committee s longer run goals.  Participants agreed to continue exploring approaches for providing the public with greater clarity about the linkages between the economic outlook and the Committee s monetary policy decisions.  Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information on United States economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook had not changed greatly since they met in December.  Some members underscored the conditional nature of the Committee s forward guidance and noted that it would be subject to revision in response to significant changes in the economic outlook.  The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.","id":95},{"text":" 3.  4.  5.  4.  5.  3.  4.  3.","id":95},{"text":" Most advanced foreign economy sovereign yields were little changed, on net, as policymakers in several countries announced additional actions aimed at maintaining accommodative financial conditions.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID 19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad.  Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to increase solidly over October and November, though the rate of monthly job gains was more moderate than the substantial third quarter pace.  The expected path of the federal funds rate, based on a straight read of overnight index swap rates, remained close to the effective lower bound through mid 2023.  The Federal Reserve maintained its pace of purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and Federal Reserve repos outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period.  Accommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sensitive expenditure categories, including residential investment and consumer durables spending.  Participants noted that overall financial conditions were accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Participants shared their views on the appropriate evolution of asset purchases once substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  Effective December 17, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.","id":24},{"text":" With regard to market expectations concerning the policy outlook, responses to the Open Market Desk surveys of dealers and market participants suggested that views on the most likely timing of the next increase in the target range for the federal funds rate coalesced further around the first half of 2024.  New activity remained limited across most Federal Reserve funding operations and section 13(3) facilities, although the Municipal Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program saw growing usage over the period, with more take up expected before their scheduled year end termination.  Both the 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees through November and the four quarter change in total labor compensation per hour in the business sector through the third quarter continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce.  Financing conditions for businesses able to access capital markets and households possessing high credit scores remained accommodative and eased a bit further in some sectors, but conditions for borrowers dependent on bank financing remained tight.  Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable maturity Treasury yields narrowed markedly across the credit spectrum, most notably for debt securities of the lowest credit quality firms.  Investor sentiment abroad improved over the intermeeting period, as favorable news on COVID 19 vaccines and the resolution of uncertainty regarding the United States election apparently outweighed concerns about another surge in COVID 19 cases and the resulting adoption of tighter social distancing restrictions in many countries.  Data provided by the Federal Reserve Small Business Lending Survey showed that standards for small businesses tightened, on net, over the third quarter, consistent with the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.  These revisions reflected incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected, although the recent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months.  As a result, the staff expected that real GDP growth would temporarily weaken in the first quarter of 2021, and the slowing seen in some of the most recent high frequency indicators of spending and employment appeared consistent with that forecast.  The inflation forecast for the rest of 2020 was revised down slightly in response to incoming data, and inflation was projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of labor and product market slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020.  Primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of COVID 19 vaccines, the staff revised up its projection of real GDP growth for 2021 as a whole, as social distancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed.  Several participants pointed out that readings on high frequency economic indicators, such as individual mobility indexes and online restaurant reservation data, might already be registering the effects of the recent rise in virus cases.  In light of these considerations, several participants assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity, and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revision of the outlook for economic activity.  Some participants noted the important role played by the various section 13(3) facilities implemented in 2020 in serving as temporary backstops to key credit markets and in helping to restore and maintain the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.  For example, if progress toward the Committee s goals proved slower than anticipated, the new guidance relayed the Committee s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  Various participants noted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its longer run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.","id":24},{"text":" Median Desk survey responses continued to suggest expectations that purchases would begin to slow in the first half of 2022 and cease altogether in 2023.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Labor market conditions improved further over October and November, although employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year.  Both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio in November were above their levels of two months earlier.  Housing sector activity advanced further, on balance, in October, supported in part by low interest rates.  Starts and construction permits for single family homes continued to rise, while starts of multi family units moved sideways.  Sales of existing homes increased solidly, though new home sales were roughly flat.  By contrast, nominal spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in October.  The pickup in the production of motor vehicles and related parts was particularly strong in November.  Federal defense spending continued to rise in October and November, although federal employment declined with the layoff of temporary census workers.  Both imports and exports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year.  Goods imports in October rose above their January level after several months of strong growth.  Survey based measures indicated that market expectations regarding the federal funds rate target range did not show a tightening until 2024.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  With historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment and speculative grade bonds remained solid in October.  Market indicators of future default expectations for corporate bonds fell slightly but remained above their pre pandemic levels.  Short term delinquencies and defaults remained relatively elevated but significantly lower than the levels observed following the financial crisis.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit.  Conditions in the asset backed securities market remained stable over the intermeeting period.  Nevertheless, the positive vaccine news received over the intermeeting period was viewed as favorable for the medium term economic outlook.  In contrast, for the medium term, participants commented that positive vaccine news had improved the economic outlook.  Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus.  Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.","id":24},{"text":" Market participants suggested that evolving expectations for United States fiscal policy as well as stronger than expected economic data and corporate earnings reports helped support equity prices.  Discussion on Asset Purchases Participants discussed the FOMC s asset purchases, including the role they are playing in supporting the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  The staff noted that financial market participants generally expected the Committee to continue its net asset purchases at the current pace through next year and at a reduced pace in subsequent years.  In contrast, goods exports by September recovered only two thirds of their decline since January despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural products and industrial supplies.  With historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment and speculative grade corporate bonds remained solid in September, moderating from robust readings in August but staying close to the averages seen in recent years.  Several participants emphasized the need to ensure that banks continue to maintain strong capital levels, as lower levels of capital are typically associated with tighter credit availability from banks.  These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.","id":25},{"text":" The Federal Reserve s balance sheet increased modestly over the intermeeting period to $7.2 trillion, as growth in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in United States dollar liquidity swaps outstanding.  The staff discussed various changes the Committee could make to the structure of its purchases, including to their pace and composition as well as to the guidance the Committee has been providing to the public about its future asset purchases.  Finally, the staff evaluated how higher levels of reserves associated with the ongoing expansion in the Federal Reserve s asset holdings might influence banks balance sheets and money market rates and discussed the various tools that the Federal Reserve has for managing money market rates in an environment with very high levels of reserves.  With market functioning seen as having largely recovered, many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering accommodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the Committee s employment and inflation goals.  A few participants indicated that asset purchases could also help guard against undesirable upward pressure on longer term rates that could arise, for example, from higher than expected Treasury debt issuance.  Most participants judged that the guidance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the Committee s securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the Committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.  Some participants noted that, if needed, the Federal Reserve could consider various steps to manage the levels of short term interest rates and the quantity of reserves, such as adjusting administered rates, expanding the overnight reverse repurchase agreement program, or implementing a maturity extension program.  The employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly labor compensation in the private sector, which likely had been less influenced than other hourly compensation measures by the concentration of recent job losses among lower wage workers, rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.  This gain was a little smaller than the index s year earlier 12 month change; in addition, the 3 month changes in the ECI in June and September were noticeably below the average pace seen over the period from 2017 through 2019.  The consumer sentiment measures from the Michigan survey and the Conference Board had moved higher, on net, since August; although both indexes stood above their April troughs, they remained well below their levels at the start of the year.  Activity in this sector was likely being supported by low interest rates, the sector s ability to adjust business practices in response to social distancing, and pent up demand following the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment was little changed over the intermeeting period against the backdrop of evolving United States election and fiscal outlooks, as well as rising COVID 19 cases in the United States and Europe.  Investor sentiment abroad turned negative over the intermeeting period amid rising COVID 19 case counts, newly adopted restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus, and indicators pointing to a slowing recovery in several foreign economies, particularly in the euro area.  At the same time, small businesses liquidity needs were high and appeared likely to increase further, with the most recent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey pointing to a majority of small businesses having no more than two months of cash on hand and many small businesses anticipating some need for additional financial assistance in the next six months.  The resulting take up of economic slack was in turn expected to cause inflation to increase gradually, and the inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 as monetary policy remained accommodative.  A few participants noted that households balance sheets generally appeared healthy and an unwinding of the large pool of household savings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater than anticipated momentum to consumer spending over coming months.  Participants noted that financial conditions were generally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Reserve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities with the approval of and, in some cases, provision of equity investments by the Treasury, were supporting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.  Some participants commented that the recent surge in virus cases in Europe and the reimposition of restrictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area and have negative spillover effects on the United States recovery.  A few participants noted that the banking system showed considerable resilience through the end of the third quarter, and a few observed that this resilience partly reflected stronger than expected balance sheets of their customers, with delinquency rates declining or showing only moderate increases.  A couple of participants expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low interest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk taking, which in turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and significant employment losses in the next economic downturn.  Several participants noted that they were encouraged by evidence that suggested that market participants expectations of the economic conditions that would likely prevail at the time of liftoff seemed broadly consistent with the Committee s forward guidance and revised consensus statement.  Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.

Commercial and industrial (C I) loans on banks balance sheets continued to decline through September, reflecting a mix of weak origination activity and the repayment of credit line draws from earlier in the year.  In particular, in the absence of clear progress toward an agreement on further fiscal stimulus, the staff removed the assumption that an additional tranche of fiscal policy support would be enacted.  Looking ahead, some business contacts expressed concerns that many households and businesses were currently in a weaker position to weather additional economic shocks than they had been at the beginning of the pandemic.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID 19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.","id":25},{"text":" This development reflected in part the recovery of TIPS market liquidity conditions from their stressed levels in the spring.

There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Participants generally saw the current pace and composition as effective in fostering accommodative financial conditions.  In addition, the overall labor force participation rate declined, and the employment to population ratio rose only slightly.  Growth in both total industrial production and manufacturing output turned negative in September after having slowed markedly in August.  As of September, manufacturing output had recovered roughly two thirds of the drop seen earlier in the year.  Overall, the broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period.  Small business loan originations dropped off sharply in August after a temporary boost from PPP distributions over the summer.  Spreads on agency CMBS were narrow, and issuance was very strong in September.  The staff assessed vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage as moderate.  Economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.  Several participants commented on the vulnerabilities witnessed during the March selloff in the Treasury market.  Most participants who commented suggested that it would be useful to continue thinking about options for refining the SEP.  Participants unanimously supported the recommended changes and agreed that they should be implemented beginning in December.

On net, the Treasury yield curve steepened modestly, corporate bond spreads narrowed somewhat, and broad equity price indexes increased.

The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in July and August, and the three year ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s Survey of Consumer Expectations also crept up over the past two months.  Participants noted that financial conditions were generally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Reserve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities in conjunction with the Treasury, were supporting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.","id":26},{"text":" In light of the improved conditions, the staff proposed that the Desk no longer be required to increase agency CMBS holdings or reinvest principal payments for agency CMBS.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for subprime borrowers.  In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected.  Participants also viewed accommodative monetary policy as contributing to gains in residential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods.  Contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sector, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to China increased.  In their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market based measures of inflation compensation had increased moderately over the intermeeting period, al though they remained low.  While the pace of corporate downgrades was seen as having decreased significantly in recent months, the delinquency rates on business loans had risen noticeably.  Most participants raised the concern that fiscal support so far for households, businesses, and state and local governments might not provide sufficient relief to these sectors.  All participants agreed that the completion of the framework review and the publication of the revised consensus statement provided a strong foundation for monetary policy decisions and communications going forward.  Overall, financial conditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.

The Committee s statement thus indicated that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the Committee s revised Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.

Housing sector activity continued to expand, likely supported by the effects of low interest rates.  Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, despite notable declines late in the intermeeting period.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed tentative signs of stabilization over the intermeeting period.  Nonetheless, low mortgage rates were supporting both home purchase originations and refinancing.  Auto loan balances increased solidly overall but declined for borrowers with low credit scores.

Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy actions.  Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.  Delinquency rates on mortgages backing CMBS fell a bit in July but remained high in the hotel and retail sectors.  Members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved.","id":26},{"text":" On a monthly basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by increases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household purchases shifted away from many consumer services.  The consumer sentiment measure from the Michigan survey edged up in August, while the Conference Board survey measure moved down; both measures continued to be below their levels at the beginning of the year.  The staff s forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.  Workers facing permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to find new jobs in different industries, and this process could take time, especially to the extent that these workers needed to be retrained.  The upturn in consumer prices was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors such as consumer durables in which demand had risen after experiencing a large decline earlier this spring.  Such scenarios could result in increases in bankruptcies and defaults, put stress on the financial system, and lead to disruptions in the flow of credit to households and businesses.  These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee s revised consensus statement.  Moreover, these participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee s flexibility for years.  Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace.  Some participants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the Committee s asset purchase program could best support the achievement of the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  Consistent with these observations, members agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in supporting accommodative financial conditions.","id":26},{"text":" By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.

Financing conditions remained tight, however, for borrowers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages.","id":27},{"text":" Over the intermeeting period, overall financial conditions eased slightly.  Market pricing suggested that the federal funds rate was expected to first rise above the current target range in 2024.  The decline was driven by the reductions in repo and United States dollar liquidity swaps outstanding.  These reductions more than offset ongoing purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio increased further in June.  Overall, however, real consumer spending remained well below the levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year.  The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey improved notably in June but fell back somewhat in July.  Sales of existing homes rose substantially over those two months, and new home sales also moved up on net.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treasury securities fell and the yield curve flattened on net.  Conditions in short term funding markets were generally stable over the intermeeting period.  The EU Recovery Fund agreement supported the euro, which appreciated about 3 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period.  Municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative, although the credit quality of municipal debt continued to show signs of weakness.  Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were generally unchanged over the intermeeting period.  In the credit card market, lending standards at commercial banks tightened further according to the July SLOOS.  Nevertheless, economic activity still appeared to have declined at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter.  Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year.  Participants noted that the rebound in consumer spending from its trough in April had been particularly strong.  Participants observed that with this rebound, household spending likely had recovered about half of its previous decline.  Several participants relayed examples of some operational difficulties their business contacts were reportedly facing in the current environment.  Several participants also commented on ongoing challenges facing the energy or farm sector despite recent improvements.  There were also concerns that the anticipated increase in Treasury debt over the next few years could have implications for market functioning.  A couple of participants noted that they believed that restrictions on shareholder payouts should be extended, while another judged that such a step would be premature.  In light of this assessment, all participants considered it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year.

In addition, weekly estimates of private sector payrolls constructed by the Board s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP, along with some other high frequency measures such as employment at small businesses and job postings suggested that employment gains had slowed since mid June but likely were still strong.  On a monthly basis, the available data indicated that consumer prices as measured by the PCE price index in May and the CPI in June had turned up after having fallen in March and April; this rebound was evident in many price categories that were most affected by social distancing measures.  In contrast, the Brazilian real depreciated about 5 percent against the dollar, amid continued policy rate cuts by the Central Bank of Brazil, escalating coronavirus cases, and political turmoil in Brazil.  Spreads on non agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) continued to decline in June, while issuance of non agency CMBS continued to show signs of moderate recovery in May and June.  The staff assessed vulnerabilities due to nonfinancial leverage to have risen from moderate to notable, reflecting declines in household incomes and business profits; such declines implied less resilient borrowers.  The staff assessed vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage to have increased from low to moderate, citing uncertainty about losses connected to business loans for banks and a higher weight on vulnerabilities connected to leverage at nonbank financial institutions.  Although the staff assumed that additional fiscal stimulus measures would be enacted beyond those anticipated in the June forecast, the positive effect on the economic outlook was outweighed somewhat by the staff s assessment of the likely effects of several other factors.  Substantial fiscal policy measures both enacted and anticipated along with appreciable support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve s liquidity and lending facilities were expected to continue bolstering the economic recovery, although a complete recovery was not expected by year end.  A number of participants observed that, with some provisions of the CARES Act set to expire shortly against the backdrop of a still weak labor market, additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the period ahead.  Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve had recently taken steps to help ensure that banks remain resilient through the pandemic, including by conducting additional sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the most recent bank stress tests and imposing temporary restrictions on shareholder payouts to preserve banks capital.  Furthermore, participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  Participants also judged that, in order to continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, it would be appropriate over coming months for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS at least at the current pace.  More broadly, in discussing the policy outlook, a number of participants observed that completing a revised Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the Committee s future policy actions and communications.  Among these costs, participants noted the possibility of an excessively rapid expansion of the balance sheet and difficulties in the design and communication of the conditions under which such a policy would be terminated, especially in conjunction with forward guidance regarding the policy rate.  In light of these concerns, many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current environment but should remain an option that the Committee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly.

Participants generally agreed that actions of consumers and businesses in taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, along with developments in public health, would be critical in ensuring a durable reopening of businesses.

The fall in exports was broad based across goods categories, while lower imports of automotive products more than offset higher imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies.  Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated further over the intermeeting period, with a sizable volume of speculative grade debt downgraded in June.  Credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria, and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated refinancing activity.  In particular, high yield and investment grade corporate bond spreads were within historical norms, and commercial real estate prices were continuing to increase despite rising vacancy rates.","id":27},{"text":" Several participants remarked that declines in the neutral rate of interest and in term premiums over the past decade and prevailing low levels of longer term yields would likely act as constraints on the effectiveness of asset purchases in the current environment and noted that these constraints were not as acute when the Committee implemented such programs in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.  Some of these participants also noted that longer term yields are importantly influenced by factors such as longer run inflation expectations and the longer run neutral real interest rate and that changes in these factors or difficulties in estimating them could result in the central bank inadvertently setting yield caps or targets at inappropriate levels.  Participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate to its ELB had established more accommodative financial conditions and that the Federal Reserve s ongoing purchases of sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency MBS had helped restore smooth market functioning to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  Participants also agreed that, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  Many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review and the release of a revised Committee statement on its goals and policy strategy, would help clarify further how the Committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.

These participants noted, however, that large scale asset purchases could still be beneficial under current circumstances by offsetting potential upward pressures on longer term yields or by helping reinforce the Committee s commitment to maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions.  Nonetheless, many participants remarked that, as long as the Committee s forward guidance remained credible on its own, it was not clear that there would be a need for the Committee to reinforce its forward guidance with the adoption of a YCT policy.  Average hourly earnings for all employees declined in May after rising sharply in April, but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and composition of employment, which disproportionately affected lower wage workers.  Spreads on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds over comparable maturity Treasury yields narrowed considerably but remained at levels similar to those in other periods of notable economic or bond market stress, though well below financial crisis levels.  In the AFEs, option implied volatility measures declined and long term sovereign bond yields rose moderately, while fiscal stimulus in Japan and Europe boosted prices in their respective equity markets.  Investment grade corporate bond issuance soared to record levels in April and remained robust in May, as issuers took advantage of more favorable market conditions following Federal Reserve announcements of two facilities to support corporate credit markets.  With regard to inflation, participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on aggregate demand was likely to more than offset any upward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflationary.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","id":28},{"text":" That optimism was reinforced by high frequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in May, though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in April.  Both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio increased in May.  The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey crept up in May but remained below their levels early in the year.  Real residential investment appeared to be weakening significantly in the second quarter.  Real business fixed investment continued to tumble in the second quarter.  Nominal business spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector also fell in April.  Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets improved over the intermeeting period.  Speculative grade corporate bond issuance picked up considerably toward the end of April from very low levels, though it slowed somewhat in May.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan downgrades remained very high in April and May.  The sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed the demand for consumer credit.  The fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity.  Participants noted that conditions in the energy sector remained difficult amid still low oil prices.  Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.","id":28},{"text":" These purchase amounts were significantly lower than the peak pace in mid March and roughly corresponded to monthly increases in SOMA holdings of approximately $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in agency MBS.  Longer term yields were likely boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury security issuance as well as some unwinding of safe haven demands in connection with improved investor sentiment.  Regarding these facilities, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility began in mid May to purchase exchange traded funds whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for United States corporate bonds.  Taken together, the data suggested that April could turn out to be the trough of the recession, but participants agreed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.  Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.","id":28},{"text":" Effective June 11, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.

The recent rebound in oil prices contributed to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso.  Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years.  The virus and the measures taken to protect public health induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.  Limited available sources of standard economic data, such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales, also seemed in line with this impression.  Risk spreads across a range of fixed income markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further.","id":28},{"text":"Discussion of Forward Guidance, Asset Purchases, and Yield Curve Caps or Targets Participants discussed tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound (ELB).  Total industrial production plunged in April, as many factories slowed or suspended operation in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Credit line drawdowns continued in April and May, though drawdowns by large firms slowed considerably from record levels in March.  The volume of mortgage rate locks for home purchase loans picked up in mid May following a material drop in April.","id":28},{"text":" Banks were able to meet surging demand for draws on credit lines while also building loan loss reserves to absorb higher expected defaults.  Values of CRE faced the risk of large declines in response to the coronavirus outbreak, al though updated readings were not yet available.  Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal programs were delivering valuable direct financial aid to households, businesses, and communities that would provide some relief during the economic shutdown.  In particular, the Cares Act and other legislation, which represented more than $2 trillion in federal spending in total, had provided direct help to households, businesses, and communities.","id":29},{"text":" The staff assessed the stability of the financial system during the coronavirus outbreak.  District contacts reported that a significant portion of workers had been able to switch to working remotely.","id":29},{"text":" Conditions in money markets had improved over recent weeks.

The overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflationary.","id":29},{"text":" Foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter of the year amid widespread mandatory business shutdowns and strict social distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.  Regarding the economic activity of households, participants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse effects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence.  In addition, the agricultural sector was under severe stress due to falling prices for some farm commodities and pandemic related disruptions, such as the closing of some food processing plants.  A number of participants emphasized that regulators should encourage banks to prepare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss absorbing capital.  Keeping the target range at the effective lower bound, after quickly reducing it by 150 basis points in March, would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.","id":29},{"text":" The virus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.  Participants discussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely.

Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined across the maturity spectrum, with the 10 and 30 year yields ending the period near all time lows.  With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee s 2 percent longer run objective before the coronavirus outbreak.  In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook.","id":29},{"text":" The manager also noted that some market participants anticipated that the Federal Reserve might increase the IOER rate in order to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range and to address market functioning issues that could arise over time with overnight rates at very low levels.  However, there appeared to be limited risk that the federal funds rate would move below the target range, as the Federal Home Loan Banks the dominant lenders in the federal funds market can earn a zero rate on balances maintained in their account at the Federal Reserve.  The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic activity of measures to contain it, together with the associated elevated level of uncertainty, were likely reflected in recent downbeat readings on business sentiment in national and regional surveys and appeared to weigh heavily on business investment.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation In the middle part of March, financial markets experienced record declines in the prices of risky assets, widespread illiquidity, and elevated volatility, as uncertainty regarding the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy jumped.  These facilities were established with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and were designed to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and state and local governments.  Following a period of extraordinarily rapid purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS by the Federal Reserve, Treasury market liquidity gradually improved through the remainder of the intermeeting period, and Treasury yields became less volatile.  Although market depth remained exceptionally low and bid ask spreads for off the run securities and long term on the run securities remained elevated, bid ask spreads for short term on the run securities fell close to levels seen earlier in the year.  Open end mutual funds that invest in corporate bonds and loans institutions that typically face a timing mismatch between investors ability to redeem shares and the funds ability to sell assets experienced heavy outflows and liquidity strains in mid March.  Participants reported that consumer spending had plummeted across all parts of the country and in most categories of spending, with especially sharp declines in expenditures for categories that had been most affected by social distancing, such as hotel, fuel, air travel, restaurant, theater, and other retail products and services.  In addition, participants expressed concern that the possibility of secondary outbreaks of the virus may cause businesses for some time to be reluctant to engage in new projects, rehire workers, or make new capital expenditures.  Participants were additionally concerned that employees who were on low incomes would be the most severely affected by job cuts because they were employed in the industries most affected by the response to the outbreak or because their jobs were not amenable to being carried out remotely.  Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health care policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by the private sector, would be important in shaping the timing and speed of the United States economy s return to more normal conditions.  Participants saw risks to banks and some other financial institutions as exacerbated by high levels of indebtedness among nonfinancial corporations that prevailed before the pandemic; this indebtedness increased these firms risk of insolvency.  Participants also assessed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.  To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, members agreed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency RMBS and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.

These participants noted that such explicit forms of forward guidance could help ensure that the public s expectations regarding the future conduct of monetary policy continued to reflect the Committee s intentions.  Effective April 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.","id":29},{"text":" The United States dollar appreciated notably against most currencies, with the exception of other safe haven currencies, and crude oil prices dropped 40 percent.  Implied rates on federal funds futures contracts suggested the Committee was expected to reduce the target range 1 full percentage point at its upcoming scheduled meeting following the 50 basis point reduction in the target range in early March.  In corporate bond markets, trading activity and liquidity were at very low levels, although not back to the low point reached in 2008.  Market participants expected that actions taken to slow the spread of the virus could have significant effects on the credit worthiness of certain borrowers, particularly those at the lower end of the credit spectrum.  A number of primary dealers found it especially difficult to make markets in off the run Treasury securities and reported that this segment of the market had ceased to function effectively.  Repo lending operations were greatly expanded to address the acute worsening in term funding markets; these operations included the addition of large scale one and three month term repo operations.  Despite the sizable offering of additional term repo, take up was well below the offered amounts, and there was little improvement in Treasury market functioning.  The Desk also revised the schedule of Treasury purchases, announcing that $37 billion of the monthly scheduled purchases would be completed on Friday, March 13.  No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in February, and the core CPI increased 2.4 percent over that same period.  The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged down in February and remained in the lower part of its prevailing range in early March.  The three year ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s Survey of Consumer Expectations edged up in February and remained in its recent range.  The components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE edged down in February, and the pace of sales of light motor vehicles in January and February was above its fourth quarter average.  However, the consumer sentiment measure from the Michigan survey started to decline notably in early March, and other daily and weekly sentiment measures such as the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, the Morning Consult confidence index, and the Rasmussen Consumer Index were also deteriorating.  Both starts and building permit issuance for single family homes increased in January over their fourth quarter averages, and starts of multifamily units also moved up.  New and existing home sales in January were both above their average fourth quarter levels.  The available data suggested that manufacturing production moved up in February after edging down in January, leaving the level of factory output little changed, on net, over the past 12 months.  Federal defense spending rose in January and February, and federal employment was boosted by hiring for the 2020 census.  State and local government payrolls expanded strongly in January and February, and nominal construction spending by these governments increased solidly in January.  Available indicators suggested that both exports and imports likely declined in February, in part reflecting disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak dominated financial market developments at home and abroad over the intermeeting period.  Equity prices, sovereign yields, and the market implied expected trajectory of the federal funds rate all plummeted, and the volatility of asset prices soared.  Late in the intermeeting period, short term funding markets showed signs of stress, with elevated demand for repo funding and increased short term spreads.  Toward the end of the period, a straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the federal funds rate would remain below 25 basis points at least until the middle of 2021.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities plummeted across the maturity spectrum, with the 10 and 30 year yields reaching all time lows at some point.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities fell sharply and reached a historical low at the 5 to 10 year horizon late in the intermeeting period.  Treasury market functioning was severely impaired late in the intermeeting period, with some dealers reportedly unwilling to make markets for clients and the normal linkage between cash and futures markets broken.  Broad stock price indexes plummeted because of a flight to safety amid escalating concerns about global economic activity.  Corporate bond spreads over comparable maturity Treasury yields widened significantly, and spreads on speculative grade energy bonds widened especially sharply amid plunging oil prices.  Overnight and term repo rates were elevated late in the intermeeting period, and the take up of the Federal Reserve s repo operations increased substantially for both overnight and term operations.  The broad dollar index strengthened notably over the period, boosted by safe haven demand, predominantly against EME currencies, and despite a significant decline in United States yields.  Policy actions by Chinese authorities supported the Chinese renminbi, which depreciated about 1.5 percent against the dollar on net.  Oil prices declined over 40 percent on expectations of lower demand due to the virus outbreak and an unexpected price cut by Saudi Arabia amid a breakdown of negotiations between OPEC and Russia to reduce production levels.  Market turmoil spilled into municipal bond markets late in the intermeeting period, as spreads widened substantially and some borrowers became hesitant to come to the market.  Capacity constraints at mortgage originators reportedly intensified, while borrower interest in refinancing increased significantly from already elevated levels.  Lenders in consumer credit markets began developing programs to assist borrowers whose finances were affected by the outbreak.  Credit card balances and auto loan balances both appeared to grow solidly through February, according to banks data, continuing their growth in the fourth quarter.  In a more adverse scenario, the economy entered recession this year, with a recovery much slower to take hold and not materially under way until next year.  Information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market remained strong through February and that economic activity rose at a moderate rate.  Although household spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak; furthermore, in recent weeks the energy sector had come under stress due to the sharp drop in oil prices.  In the past week, pullbacks in purchases at retail stores, except for emergency buying, had reportedly intensified significantly.  Many United States businesses had moved to telework arrangements; other businesses, however, could not readily shift to telework status or had limited telework technology.  Participants observed that the coronavirus outbreak had inevitably hurt business confidence and that the expected length and severity of the restrictions on economic activity that involved in person interaction would importantly affect the size of the response of investment spending to the situation.  Several participants emphasized concern about the capacity of the health care system in the current situation and welcomed measures taken to prevent the system s overall capacity from being exceeded.  Participants noted that foreign economic growth for the first half of this year would be badly hit by the severe disruptions to economic activity abroad associated with the response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the recent measures taken in major European countries.  Measures that reportedly helped partially substitute for layoffs included the encouragement by employers of voluntary leaves of absence, non replacement of departing workers, and increased reliance on the delivery of goods to customers in place of on site purchases.  Participants commented that workers most severely affected in the current situation were those who were ill, those with low incomes, those connected to the most hard hit sectors, and those with irregular or contingent employment.  Participants raised several alternative scenarios with regard to the likely behavior of economic activity in the second half of this year.  Participants agreed that the Federal Reserve s efforts to relieve stress in financial markets would help limit downside near term outcomes by supporting credit flows to households and businesses, and that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would provide support to economic activity beyond the near term.  Participants commented on the conditions of high volatility and illiquidity characterizing the markets for United States Treasury securities, especially off the run longer term securities, and for agency MBS.  Participants expressed concern about the disruptions to the functioning of these markets, especially in view of their status as cornerstones for the operation of the United States and global financial systems and for the transmission of monetary policy.  Participants observed that Federal Reserve operations in recent days had provided some relief with regard to the liquidity problems, but they noted that severe illiquidity continued to prevail in key securities markets.  Participants also discussed the implications of recent financial market turbulence for money market funds and government bond funds and for debt issuance by state and local governments.  In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, to 0 to 1/4 percent.  A few participants preferred a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and noted that such a decision would provide support to economic activity in the face of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus.  These participants preferred to wait until there was greater assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and businesses was working effectively.  In addition, these participants noted that a lowering of the target range by 100 basis points, coming so soon after the reduction of 50 basis points less than two weeks earlier, ran the risk of sending an overly negative signal about the economic outlook.  Participants also considered open market operations to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS to support the smooth functioning of these securities markets, which in turn would help support the supply of credit to households and businesses.  Participants generally agreed that, over the coming months, it would be appropriate to increase the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its holdings of agency MBS by at least $200 billion.  Those Treasury and agency MBS purchases would be in addition to the recently expanded overnight and term repo operations conducted by the Desk.  Participants stressed that it was important to communicate that the Committee would be prepared to increase the size of the securities purchases, as needed, on the basis of its close monitoring of market conditions.  Some participants remarked that the Committee s policy actions regarding the target range and balance sheet could be interpreted as conveying negative news about the economic outlook.  Participants generally commented that these additional measures would be helpful in supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  A few other participants noted that discount window stigma should be less of a concern than it was previously.  Several participants commented that banks should be discouraged from repurchasing shares from, or paying dividends to, their equity holders in the wake of the proposed measures.  In light of these developments, almost all members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent.  These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.  Members emphasized that the Federal Reserve was prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee instructs the Desk to conduct these purchases at a pace appropriate to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS.  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate.  The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.  Voting against this action Loretta J. Mester President Mester was fully supportive of all of the actions taken to promote the smooth functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses but voted against the FOMC action because she preferred to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent at this meeting.  Money markets had been resilient during the broader financial market volatility; pricing and trading conditions in offshore United States dollar funding markets had also been stable.  The staff then provided an update on current conditions and changes to the economic outlook since the FOMC s January meeting.  All told, foreign economic activity was expected to be significantly weaker during the first half of 2020 than the staff had anticipated at the time of the January FOMC meeting.  FOMC participants discussed the significant outbreaks of the coronavirus that had emerged recently in a few countries outside China and the likelihood that the virus would spread widely around the world, including in the United States.  Accordingly, participants supported a reduction of 50 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.","id":30},{"text":" Participants expressed their deep concern for those whose health had been harmed and observed that the matter was, above all, a public health emergency.

By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with three sets of changes, effective February 1, 2020.  Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Participants continued their discussion related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.  Consequently, policy strategies and tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Committee s objective in a low neutral rate environment can help promote financial stability.  The staff noted that clear communications of the Committee s ongoing assessments of the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities.  In their discussion of the effects that alternative monetary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the Committee s dual mandate depended on a stable financial system.  In addition, some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabilities were associated with excessive risk taking behavior that did not seem to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates.  A number of participants judged that, under some circumstances, low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided they are needed to support strong economic conditions and price stability.  Several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures.  Participants continued to anticipate that the review will likely be completed around the middle of this year.  Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial market participants views on the likely course of United States monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period.  Market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in downside risks partly to the Committee s communications; some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range.  Ongoing reserve management purchases of Treasury bills and the Desk s repurchase agreement (repo) operations kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in early September, contributing to relatively calm money market conditions around year end.  Market participants cited funding from the additional longer term repo operations spanning year end and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in short term funding markets.  In addition, market participants prepared earlier than usual for year end, with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity.  The manager discussed a potential plan for gradually transitioning to an operational approach designed to maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of repo operations to supply reserves.  As part of this transition, the minimum bid rate on repo operations could be gradually lifted, and the Committee could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework.  As that time approaches, the Committee might wish to consider the appropriate maturity composition of reserve management purchases of Treasury securities.  No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the January 28 29 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 2019 was somewhat above that for the first half.  The average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in November stayed below its level in late 2007.  Nominal wage growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December.  The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years moved back up in early January after having fallen to its lowest value on record in December.  Retail sales were soft during the fourth quarter, and sales of light motor vehicles declined in December after a strong gain in November.  However, key factors that influence consumer spending including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households net worth, and generally low interest rates remained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  In addition, recent readings on consumer confidence from both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board surveys were strong.  Starts for single family homes increased sharply over the November and December period, building permit issuance for such homes rose on net, and starts of multifamily units also moved up.  All told, the data on residential construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 had been boosting housing activity.  Although some measures of business sentiment improved, analysts expectations of firms longer term profit growth edged down further, concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms investment decisions, and reduced deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max were likely restraining investment.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in November.  The total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector was little changed, on net, through mid January, though still below levels seen over the latter part of 2019.  Automakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the first quarter, but that gain appeared likely to be offset by Boeing s curtailed production of the 737 Max aircraft and, more generally, by mixed readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys.  Real net exports were estimated to have provided a substantial boost to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  Available monthly data suggested that imports fell significantly, led by declines in consumer goods and automobiles, while exports were about flat.  In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, while the labor strike at General Motors was a further drag on Mexico s already weak economy.  Foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in India and China, while it remained soft in most AFEs, in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pressures.  Financing conditions for businesses and households eased a bit further and generally remained supportive of spending and economic activity.  Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period reportedly reinforced investors beliefs that a near term change to the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely.  Consistent with those reports, a straight read of the probability distributions for the federal funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged over the next few months.  Overall movements in stock prices varied widely across economic sectors, with stocks of firms in the information technology and utilities sectors significantly outperforming aggregate indexes, while stock prices of firms in the energy sector declined markedly.  Conditions in domestic short term funding markets, including in secured financing, were stable over the intermeeting period, even over year end.  Rates declined slightly, likely reflecting increased liquidity and a higher level of reserves provided by the Desk s open market operations.  For most of the intermeeting period, foreign equity prices rose amid progress on U.S. China trade negotiations, generally favorable data on global economic activity, and the reduced risk of a disorderly Brexit following the U.K. general election.  The Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar on positive trade policy developments, but this gain was more than undone late in the period by concerns about the coronavirus.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on balance, with corporate borrowing costs staying near historical lows during the intermeeting period.  Issuance of speculative grade bonds over the intermeeting period remained about in line with the average pace over December and January in recent years.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust in December, reflecting solid refinancing activity and moderate new money issuance.  The volume of agency and non agency commercial mortgage backed securities issuance grew notably in the fourth quarter, buoyed by lower interest rates, and the growth of CRE loans on banks books picked up over this period.  Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS suggested that lending standards and demand for most CRE loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained supportive of growth in consumer spending, although the supply of credit remained relatively tight for nonprime borrowers.  Asset valuation pressures were characterized as fairly widespread across a number of markets, similar to the situation in much of 2017 and 2018.  In assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, while the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP was fairly low, the ratio of business debt to nominal GDP was high by historical standards.  Important factors influencing this assessment were that foreign economic and geopolitical developments still seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the United States economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production last year, as well as the recent weakness in imports, was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.  Some participants noted the upbeat tone of consumer surveys, and a few commented that their District contacts had reported solid retail sales during the holiday shopping season.  With respect to the business sector, participants observed that business investment and exports remained weak and that manufacturing output had declined over the past year.  Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth.  Many participants expressed the view that these developments might boost business confidence or raise export demand, which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business investment.  Al though the upcoming annual benchmark revision was expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth, participants expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.  Business contacts in many Districts indicated continued strong labor demand, with several participants mentioning that contacts reported difficulties in finding qualified workers or that observed wage growth might currently understate the degree of tightness in the labor market.  However, a number of participants indicated that aggregate measures of nominal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation.  Many participants pointed to the strong performance of labor force participation despite the downward pressures associated with an aging population, and several raised the possibility that there was some room for labor force participation to rise further.  Participants generally expected inflation to move closer to 2 percent in the coming months as the unusually low readings in early 2019 drop out of the 12 month calculation.  In addition, statistical models designed to estimate the probability of recession using financial market data suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the next year had fallen notably in recent months.  Still, participants generally expected trade related uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of stabilization in global growth could fade.  In their discussion of financial stability, participants acknowledged the staff report suggesting that overall financial vulnerabilities remained moderate and that the financial system remained resilient.  Nonetheless, several participants observed that equity, corporate debt, and CRE valuations were elevated and drew attention to high levels of corporate indebtedness and weak underwriting standards in leveraged loan markets.  With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook.  With regard to the Committee s maximum employment objective, a few participants observed that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the economy to achieve that maximum level.  Participants observed that enactment of this plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to levels at or above those prevailing in early September 2019 and in ensuring continued control of the federal funds rate.  Many participants stressed that, as reserves approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would diminish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  Members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.  Effective January 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.

The staff summarized the feedback received through the Fed Listens initiative, a series of 14 public facing events conducted around the country with a broad range of individuals and groups.  Representatives from underserved communities who participated in the Fed Listens events generally saw the current strong labor market as providing significant benefits to their communities, most notably by creating greater opportunities for individuals who have experienced difficulty finding jobs in the past.  Business representatives reported experiencing challenges finding qualified workers and described several initiatives to attract and retain workers, including training programs and a willingness to employ individuals who are unlikely to have been considered in less favorable labor market conditions.  Representatives of retirees mentioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of health care and prescription drugs, whereas those representing low and middle income communities pointed to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing, utilities, and food.  Event participants were asked about monetary policymakers concerns regarding overall inflation running persistently below 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns.  When asked about the effects of changes in interest rates, representatives of underserved communities said that such changes had little effect on many members of their communities who have limited or no access to credit.  The staff used simulations from a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heterogeneity of households might affect the transmission of economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the economy.  Overall, the analysis suggested that the costs of recessions, as well as the benefits of economic stabilization, might be larger than suggested by models that did not account for differences across households regarding their access to credit.  Participants agreed that the Fed Listens outreach efforts had informed their understanding of the goals and tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had provided highly useful input into their deliberations.  Participants also shared their appreciation of the feedback they receive on a regular basis from members of the public, including through the Federal Reserve System s extensive networks of contacts and community outreach efforts.  Several participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor market conditions helps workers build skills and cement their attachment to the labor force in a manner that might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns and might increase the maximum sustainable level of employment over the longer run.  In addition, a couple of participants cautioned that maintaining accommodative financial conditions could be counterproductive if doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the next economic downturn.  Regarding expectations for United States monetary policy, the Open Market Trading Desk s surveys and market based indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Reserve management purchases of Treasury bills continued at a pace of $60 billion per month, with propositions remaining strong and little discernible effect on market functioning.  The first involved the risk that future Treasury bill purchases could have a larger effect on liquidity in the Treasury bill market in light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and the Federal Reserve s growing ownership share of outstanding bills.  If this risk were to materialize, the Federal Reserve could consider expanding the universe of securities purchased for reserve management purposes to include coupon bearing Treasury securities with a short time to maturity.  The manager also noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York communicated to its customers that the remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be revised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse repo rate.  Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in November, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in October.  The employment cost index for private sector workers rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November.  Key factors that influence consumer spending including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households net worth, and generally low interest rates were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  The Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment rose again in early December to an upbeat level and had more than recovered from its drop in August; the Conference Board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level in November.  Production in October continued to be held down by the strike at General Motors, al though the end of the strike and automakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would rebound in November.  Available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly negative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter.  Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as suggesting that additional near term changes to the target range for the federal funds rate were less likely than had previously been expected.  A straight read of the probability distribution for the federal funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting.  Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed to trade related developments and stronger than expected United States employment reports.  Political unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America garnered some financial market attention and led to a weakening of some Latin American currencies, notably the Chilean peso, but the imprint on broader financial markets was limited.  Important factors influencing this assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the United States economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.  With respect to the business sector, participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global economic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports.  The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources.  In addition, a couple of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year.  As reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook.  A number of participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the Committee some time to assess the full effects on the economy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year along with other information bearing on the economic outlook.  A few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risk taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector.  Effective December 12, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.","id":32},{"text":" Most participants who reported on spending by households in their Districts also cited favorable conditions for consumer spending, al though several participants reported mixed data on spending or an increase in precautionary savings in their Districts.  In their discussions of the business sector, participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports and the associated restraint on domestic economic growth.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the September meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to update the language of the Committee s description of incoming data to acknowledge that investment spending and United States exports had remained weak.","id":33},{"text":" In addition, the staff presentation noted that taking account of investor expectations ahead of the announcement of each new program the effects of asset purchases did not appear to have diminished materially across consecutive programs.  Late in the period, quotes on federal funds futures options contracts indicated that market participants assigned a very high probability to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range of the federal funds rate at the October FOMC meeting.  Even without this downward revision, real GDP was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spending.","id":33},{"text":" The briefing also discussed lending programs that could facilitate the flow of credit to households or businesses.  The risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the domestic economy remained prominent.","id":33},{"text":" On a 12 month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent.  A couple of participants noted that some measures of inflation could temporarily move above 2 percent early next year because of the transitory effects of tariffs.

Many participants also cited the level of inflation or inflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  On a 12 month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.","id":33},{"text":" Financing conditions for businesses and households remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained generally accommodative during the intermeeting period.

With estimates of equilibrium real interest rates having declined notably over recent decades, policymakers saw less room to reduce the federal funds rate to support the economy in the event of a downturn.  The Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment rose again in October and had mostly recovered from its August slump, while the Conference Board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level.  In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  They also generally expected that, in the period ahead, household spending would likely remain on a firm footing, supported by strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and favorable financial conditions.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.","id":33},{"text":" The manager pro tem finished by noting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would soon release a request for public comment on a plan to publish a series of backward looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) averages and a daily SOFR index to support the transition away from instruments based on LIBOR (London interbank offered rate).  In their comments following the staff presentation, participants emphasized the importance of maintaining reserves at a level consistent with the Committee s choice of an ample reserves monetary policy implementation framework, in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve s administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.  Several of these participants also suggested that, if a standing facility were created that allowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which could make it feasible for the monetary policy implementation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be needed.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed, on balance, al though the Michigan survey measure ticked down to the low end of its recent range.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":33},{"text":" The staff discussed the benefits and costs associated with the large scale asset purchase programs implemented by the Federal Reserve after the financial crisis.  Participants discussed the relative merits of qualitative, date based, and outcome based forward guidance.  On the other hand, flow based asset purchase programs may result in the balance sheet rising to undesirable levels.  A few participants saw benefits to capping longer term interest rates that more directly influence household and business spending.  Real residential investment turned up solidly in the third quarter following six consecutive quarters of contraction.  Mortgage rates were little changed since the September FOMC meeting and stayed near their lowest level since mid 2016.  This revision reflected the estimated effects of the strike at General Motors along with some other small factors.  Al though household spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak.  Market based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed.  Participants discussed developments in the manufacturing, energy, and agricultural sectors of the United States economy.  Market based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed.","id":33},{"text":" However, going forward, such policies might not be as effective because longer term interest rates would likely be much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase program than they were before the financial crisis.  Participants generally agreed that the balance sheet policies implemented by the Federal Reserve after the crisis had eased financial conditions and had contributed to the economic recovery, and that those tools had become an important part of the Committee s current toolkit.  With respect to purchases of Treasury bills for reserve management purposes, the Desk had purchased more than half of the initial $60 billion monthly amount for October, and propositions at the five operations conducted to date had been strong.  And by effectively standing ready to provide a form of liquidity on an as needed basis, such a facility could increase the risk that some institutions may take on an undesirably high amount of liquidity risk.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower pace in September than in the previous two months, but the average pace for the third quarter was similar to that for the first half of the year.  Several participants commented that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year.","id":33},{"text":" Participants also discussed the benefits and costs of using different types of balance sheet policy.  Real nonresidential private fixed investment declined further in the third quarter.  Some participants favored maintaining the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.","id":33},{"text":" A number of participants judged that the review could be completed around the middle of 2020.  On balance, United States financial conditions ended the period little changed.  On net, corporate credit spreads were little changed.","id":33},{"text":" Nonetheless, the staff suggested that forward guidance generally had been effective in easing financial conditions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances when the policy rate was above the ELB and when it was at the ELB.  Overall, participants generally agreed that the forward guidance and balance sheet policies followed by the Federal Reserve after the financial crisis had been effective in providing stimulus at the ELB.  However, the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to keep the federal funds rate in the target range also calmed dollar funding conditions in the foreign exchange swap market.  In the October SLOOS, banks left their lending standards basically unchanged for most residential real estate loan categories over the third quarter.  In addition, the labor strike at General Motors had disrupted motor vehicle output, and ongoing issues at Boeing were slowing manufacturing in the commercial aircraft industry.  Many participants continued to view the downside risks surrounding the economic outlook as elevated, further underscoring the case for a rate cut at this meeting.","id":33},{"text":" Participants commented that there was limited scope to bring the policy rate into negative territory, that the evidence on the beneficial effects of negative interest rates abroad was mixed, and that it was unclear what effects negative rates might have on the willingness of financial intermediaries to lend and on the spending plans of households and businesses.  They generally agreed that they should continue to monitor the market effects of the Federal Reserve s ongoing repo operations and Treasury bill purchases and that additional analysis of the recent period of money market dislocations or of fluctuations in the Federal Reserve s non reserve liabilities was warranted.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment weakened over the early part of the intermeeting period, reflecting a few weaker than expected domestic data releases, but later strengthened on increased optimism regarding ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China and positive Brexit news.  In particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending remained prominent.  In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve s non reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.","id":33},{"text":" A number of participants noted that each of these three forms of forward guidance could be effective in providing accommodation, depending on circumstances both at and away from the ELB.  On net, equity prices and corporate bond spreads were little changed, and the Treasury yield curve steepened a bit.  Additionally, banks reported that their standards on auto loans and their willingness to make consumer installment loans were about unchanged on balance.  In addition, survey measures of consumer confidence remained high, and a couple of participants commented that business contacts in consumer facing industries reported strong demand.  Manufacturing production remained weak, and continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term.  While survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were generally little changed, some measures of households inflation expectations had moved down to historically low levels.","id":33},{"text":" However, some participants pointed out that research had produced a sizable range of estimates of the magnitude of the economic effects of balance sheet actions.  The probability that survey respondents placed on this outcome was broadly similar to the probability of a 25 basis point cut ahead of the July and September meetings.  Yields on nominal United States Treasury securities moved down in the early part of the intermeeting period but later retraced their declines.  Interest rates on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through August.  Appetite for risk in the leveraged loan market remained elevated, but less so than last year, especially for lower rated loans.  Many participants noted that components of household spending that are thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had improved, including purchases of consumer durables.","id":33},{"text":" Staff briefings provided an assessment of the risk that the federal funds rate could, in some future downturn, be constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) and discussed options for mitigating the costs associated with this constraint.  Participants generally agreed with the staff s analysis that the risk of future ELB episodes had likely increased over time, and that future ELB episodes and the reduced effect of resource utilization on inflation could inhibit the Committee s ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside the drilling and mining sector decreased in July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector continued to decline through mid September.  The volume of agency and non agency commercial mortgage backed securities issuance was slightly weaker in July and August than in the same period last year, though industry analysts reportedly anticipated that issuance would soon pick up in response to recent declines in interest rates.  In addition, a number of participants suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely better align the target range with a variety of indicators of the appropriate policy stance, including those based on estimates of the neutral interest rate.  Several participants additionally stressed that survey measures of longer term inflation expectations and market based measures of inflation compensation were near historical lows and that these values pointed to the possibility that inflation expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective or could soon fall below such levels.  The staff presented a proposal to lower the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate by 5 basis points, relative to the target range for the federal funds rate, in order to foster trading of federal funds within the target range.","id":34},{"text":" The increased ELB risk was attributed in part to structural changes in the United States economy that had lowered the longer run real short term interest rate and thus the neutral level of the policy rate.  That said, reports from business contacts in many Districts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with some firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups.  However, business fixed investment and exports had weakened, and this outcome suggested that risks and uncertainty associated with international trade developments and with ongoing weakness in global economic growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic economy.","id":34},{"text":" Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased in July, and forward looking indicators generally pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending.  Financing conditions for businesses and households were largely unaffected by the intermeeting turbulence in financial markets and remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity.  In consumer asset backed securities markets, issuance was solid, and spreads remained at relatively low levels, though somewhat above their post crisis averages.  Participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to the economic outlook that further underscored the case for such a move.","id":34},{"text":" Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem first discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Changes in the stance of policy, they believed, should instead occur only when the macroeconomic data readily justified those moves.","id":34},{"text":" Because of the downside risk to inflation and employment associated with the ELB, most participants were open to the possibility that the dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices could be best served by strategies that deliver inflation rates that over time are, on average, equal to the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent.  Several participants commented that, in the wake of this increase in downside risk, the weakness in business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring, a development that would likely weigh on consumption and the overall economic outlook.  Participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the Committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in the context of the ample reserves regime that the Committee had chosen.","id":34},{"text":" On net, the EFFR averaged 2.14 percent over the current intermeeting period, with the spread to the IOER rate down a bit relative to the previous intermeeting period.  Both of these supply side adjustments led to a somewhat higher projected path for potential output, implying that estimates of current and projected resource utilization were less tight than the staff previously assumed.  Several also noted that, because monetary policy actions affected economic activity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requisite policy accommodation now to support economic activity over coming quarters.","id":34},{"text":" Even after the partial rebound in September, market and survey based indicators of policy rate expectations suggested that investors viewed it as very likely that the Committee would ease policy further at this meeting.  With regard to developments in financial markets, participants noted that longer term United States Treasury rates had been volatile over the intermeeting period but, on net, had registered a sizable decline.  Open market operations conducted on the previous day had helped to ease strains in money markets, but the EFFR had nonetheless printed 5 basis points above the top of the target range.","id":34},{"text":" Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 4.4 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, a faster rate than a year earlier.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent.  Broad equity price indexes were down as much as 6 percent in early August but almost fully recovered by the end of the intermeeting period.  If policymakers provided adequate accommodation while still away from the ELB, this course of action would help forestall the possibility of a prolonged ELB episode.","id":34},{"text":" The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money market conditions.  Market participants reportedly expected that additional temporary open market operations would be necessary both over subsequent days and around the end of the quarter.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  The average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in July and August continued to be below its level in late 2007.  Real consumer expenditures appeared to be rising solidly in the third quarter after expanding strongly in the second quarter.  Real nonresidential private fixed investment looked to be declining further in the third quarter.  Total real government purchases appeared to be rising at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the second quarter.  Recent indicators suggested widespread weakness in manufacturing abroad even as services activity appeared to be holding up relatively well.  Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities declined on net.  Equity prices were also boosted by better than anticipated corporate earnings and retail sector data.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative.  Overall issuance of corporate bonds was solid in August, driven by resilient investment grade issuance.  While speculative grade corporate bond issuance was somewhat subdued in August, it was comparable to that seen over the same period in 2018.  Credit conditions for both small businesses and municipalities remained accommodative on balance.  Many participants expected that real GDP growth would moderate to around its potential rate in the second half of the year.  Several participants favored maintaining the existing target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  A couple of participants indicated their preference for a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.","id":34},{"text":" Participants noted that there had been little change in their economic outlook since the July meeting and that incoming data had continued to suggest that the pace of economic expansion was consistent with the maintenance of strong labor market conditions.  One risk that the economy faced was that the softness recorded of late in firms capital formation, manufacturing, and exporting activities might spread to their hiring decisions, with adverse implications for household income and spending.  A few of the participants favoring an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate financial imbalances.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the July meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.","id":34},{"text":" Automakers assembly schedules indicated that the production of light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near term (al though the labor strike at General Motors was expected to temporarily disrupt vehicle production), while new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys and a persistent drag from trade tariffs pointed toward continued softness in factory output in coming months.  Despite the volatility in many domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period, conditions in domestic short term funding markets remained stable until the Monday before the September FOMC meeting, when flows associated with a combination of corporate tax payments and Treasury coupon securities settlements led to significant tightening of conditions, particularly for overnight funding.  Participants agreed that any Committee decision regarding the trend pace of balance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of reserve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implementation should be clearly distinguished from past large scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the Federal Reserve s asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommodation and ease overall financial conditions.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage backed securities.","id":34},{"text":" Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, financial market developments reflected noticeable shifts in expectations for monetary policy in response to Federal Reserve communications, economic data releases, and trade policy developments.  Within business debt, the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market, the share of new loans to risky borrowers was at a record high, and credit extended by private equity firms had continued to grow.  At the same time, financial institutions were viewed as resilient, as the risks associated with financial leverage and funding risk were still viewed as low despite some signs of rising leverage and continued inflows into run prone funds.  Noting the important role that household spending was currently playing in supporting the expansion, participants judged that household spending would likely continue to be supported by strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer sentiment.  Several of these participants commented that the fact that wage pressures had remained only moderate despite the low unemployment rate could be a sign that the longer run normal level of the unemployment rate is appreciably lower than often assumed.  Market based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly from the low levels recorded in June, but a portion of this change likely reflected the expectation by market participants of additional near term monetary accommodation.","id":35},{"text":" Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed on net.  Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained generally supportive of spending.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds remained robust in June, followed by a typical seasonal decline in July.  Credit conditions for both small businesses and municipalities remained accommodative on balance.  Refinance originations have risen as well but remain near historical lows.  Job gains in June were stronger than expected, following a weak reading in May.","id":35},{"text":" Within exports, declines were particularly notable for exports of consumer goods and capital goods, the latter of which had already been depressed by the suspension of Boeing 737 MAX exports.  Important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the United States economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed.  Looking ahead, participants expected the labor market to remain strong, with the pace of job gains slower than last year but above what is estimated to be necessary to hold labor utilization steady.  Among those participants who commented on financial stability, most highlighted recent credit market developments, the elevated valuations in some asset markets, and the high level of nonfinancial corporate indebtedness.  A few participants expressed the concern that capital ratios at the largest banks had continued to fall at a time when they should ideally be rising and that capital ratios were expected to decline further.  In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, those participants who favored a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate pointed to three broad categories of reasons for supporting that action.  More generally, such developments were among those that had led most participants over recent quarters to revise down their estimates of the policy rate path that would be appropriate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.","id":35},{"text":" The staff judged asset valuation pressures to be notable in a number of markets, supported in part by the low level of Treasury yields.  Participants generally noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that the economy had been resilient in the face of ongoing global developments.  One member also noted that a further easing in policy at a time when the economy is very strong and asset prices are elevated could have adverse implications for financial stability.","id":35},{"text":" Manufacturing production had declined so far this year, dragged down in part by weak real exports, the ongoing global slowdown, and trade uncertainties.  In addition, many participants noted that the recent agreement on the federal debt ceiling and budget appropriations substantially reduced near term fiscal policy uncertainty.  Strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending, but modest growth in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures remained muted.","id":35},{"text":" Regarding market participants views about the July FOMC meeting, nearly all respondents from the July Open Market Desk surveys of dealers and market participants expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate, a substantial shift from the June surveys when a significant majority had a modal forecast for no change.  Regarding balance sheet policy, survey respondents that expected a rate cut at this meeting were almost evenly split on whether the Committee would also choose to end balance runoff immediately after the meeting or to maintain the existing plan to halt runoff at the end of September.  The spreads of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the median Eurodollar rate relative to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate had increased some and become more variable over recent months, with a notable pickup in daily changes in these spreads since late March.  The rate of private sector job openings held steady in May, while the rate of quits edged down but was still at a high level; the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid July was near historically low levels.  The preliminary July reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved back up after dipping in June but was still at a relatively low level; the measures from the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed.  Staff Economic Outlook The projection for United States economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was revised up somewhat in the near term, as an upward revision to households real disposable income in the first half of the year led to a slightly higher second half forecast for consumer spending.  A few participants expressed the concern that the inversion of the Treasury yield curve, as evidenced by the 10 year yield falling below the 3 month yield, had persisted for about two months, which could indicate that market participants anticipated weaker economic conditions in the future and that the Federal Reserve would soon need to lower the federal funds rate substantially in response.  In explaining their policy views, those members noted that economic data collected over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee s 2 percent target.  Members generally agreed that it was important to maintain optionality in setting the future target range for the federal funds rate and, more generally, that near term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  Ending the runoff of securities holdings two months earlier than initially planned was seen as having only very small effects on the balance sheet, with negligible implications for the economic outlook, and was helpful in simplifying communications regarding the usage of the Committee s policy tools.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities up to $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage backed securities.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.","id":35},{"text":" Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in June.

Al though growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft.","id":35},{"text":" However, new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed toward continued softness in manufacturing production in coming months.  Overnight interest rates in both unsecured and secured markets were somewhat elevated over the period.  The staff provided an update on its assessments of potential risks to financial stability.  On balance, the staff continued to view vulnerabilities as moderate.  In contrast, a couple of participants reported that some recent indicators of housing activity in their Districts had been somewhat more positive of late.","id":35},{"text":" Notably, the British pound depreciated significantly against the United States dollar, reportedly as developments led investors to raise the probability they attached to a no deal Brexit.  The economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, and participants generally expected GDP growth to slow a bit to around its estimated potential rate in the second half of the year.","id":35},{"text":"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and international financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Take up at the System s overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement facility dropped to relatively low levels over the period.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  The national labor force participation rate was lower in November than it had been in September but remained in the range seen over the past several years.  Automakers schedules indicated that light motor vehicle assemblies would likely move up in the coming months.  Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further increases in factory output in the near term.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth continued to be supportive of moderate real PCE growth in the fourth quarter.  Exports picked up in September, led by exports of industrial supplies, but were flat in October.  On net, the Treasury yield curve flattened, United States equity prices moved up, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.  Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases over the intermeeting period were characterized by market participants as reinforcing perceptions of a likely increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting.  Spreads on both investment and speculative grade corporate bond yields over comparable maturity Treasury yields were about flat on net.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate held steady, and rates and volumes in other overnight markets were little changed.  On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was little changed over the intermeeting period and appeared to remain solid.  In the residential mortgage market, al though credit standards had loosened gradually for borrowers with low credit scores, they continued to be tight for borrowers with low credit scores and hard to document incomes.  The euro appreciated modestly against the United States dollar, in part because of strong economic data for the euro area early in the intermeeting period.  However, developments related to Venezuela generated little spillover to global financial markets.  Real GDP was forecast to have increased at a solid pace in the second half of 2017.  Downside risks to inflation included the possibility that longer term inflation expectations may move lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected.  Participants judged that hurricane related disruptions and rebuilding had affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but had not materially altered the outlook for the national economy.  They saw the incoming information on spending and the labor market as consistent with continued above trend growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions.  Participants expected moderate growth in consumer spending in the near term, underpinned by ongoing strength in the labor market, further improvements in households net worth, and buoyant consumer sentiment.  Many participants expected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending.  The resulting increase in the capital stock could contribute to positive supply side effects, including an expansion of potential output over the next few years.  In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.  Against the backdrop of the continued strengthening in labor market conditions, participants discussed recent wage developments.  In a couple of regions, businesses facing tight labor market conditions were said to be offering more flexible work arrangements or taking advantage of technology to use employees more efficiently, rather than raising wages.  These participants generally judged that much of the softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the influence of these factors waned.  Based on their current assessments, almost all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Nonetheless, members reiterated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.","id":48},{"text":" The British pound was somewhat volatile amid Brexit related developments, and the Mexican peso fluctuated on news about negotiations associated with the North American Free Trade Agreement, but both currencies ended the period little changed.  Following missed interest payments on its sovereign bonds, Venezuela was assigned selective default status by two credit rating agencies in early November, which precipitated a credit event ruling by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.  In their discussion of economic conditions and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in November indicated that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen.  A few participants judged that the tightness in labor markets was likely to translate into an acceleration in wages; however, another observed that the absence of broad based upward wage pressures suggested that there might be scope for further improvement in labor market conditions.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.","id":48},{"text":" However, some business contacts and respondents to business surveys suggested that firms were cautious about expanding capital spending in response to the proposed tax changes or noted that the increase in cash flow that would result from corporate tax cuts was more likely to be used for mergers and acquisitions or for debt reduction and stock buybacks.  Several of them expressed concern that persistently weak inflation may have led to a decline in longer term inflation expectations; they pointed to low market based measures of inflation compensation, declines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years.  A couple of participants did not believe it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting; these participants suggested that the Committee should maintain the target range at 1 to 1 1/4 percent until the actual rate of inflation had moved further toward the Committee s 2 percent longer run objective or inflation expectations had increased.","id":48},{"text":"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets since the September FOMC meeting.  Broad equity price indexes extended earlier increases, yields on longer term Treasury securities rose, yield spreads on corporate bonds declined, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar increased.  Money market interest rates suggested that market participants did not anticipate a change in the Committee s target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting but saw a high probability of a 25 basis point increase at the Committee s December meeting.  Over the intermeeting period, federal funds continued to trade near the center of the FOMC s target range except on quarter end.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Retail gasoline prices jumped in the aftermath of the hurricanes, but total consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in September and was lower than early in the year.  The employment cost index for private workers increased 2 1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, a little faster than in the 12 month period ending a year earlier.  Automakers schedules indicated that light motor vehicle assemblies would increase in the fourth quarter.  Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to an expansion in factory output in the near term.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including gains in real disposable personal income and households net worth remained supportive of solid increases in real PCE in the near term.  Export growth was driven by higher exports of capital goods and consumer goods, while the import decline was led by lower imports of industrial supplies and capital goods.  Despite this widening, net exports were reported to have contributed positively to real GDP growth for the third quarter as a whole.  Retail gasoline prices moved up sharply following the hurricanes and put upward pressure on total PCE prices in August and September; gasoline prices subsequently moved down somewhat through late October.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed on balance.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities declined somewhat following the slightly lower than expected September CPI data but were little changed on net.  Broad equity price indexes rose notably, reportedly reflecting in part investors perceptions that tax reform was becoming more likely.  At the end of September, changes in money market rates and volumes were short lived and in line with previous quarter ends.  Responses to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggested that lackluster demand among banks business customers was a key factor in this subdued growth.  Spreads on lower rated CMBS over Treasury securities widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the lower end of the range seen since the financial crisis.  Credit conditions in the residential mortgage market stayed accommodative in the third quarter for most borrowers.  The October SLOOS suggested that the recent slowdown in mortgage originations for home purchases was partly attributable to weaker demand.  Credit bureau data on loan originations and credit limits suggested that this tightening was most pronounced in the subprime segment of the market.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.  Participants acknowledged that hurricane related disruptions and rebuilding would continue to affect economic activity in the near term, and they noted that, in October, wildfires in California had displaced many households.  They continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Participants expected solid growth in consumer spending in the near term, supported by ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and a high level of consumer sentiment.  Improved demand from abroad, rising business profits, and the substitution of capital for labor in response to tightening labor markets were viewed as factors supporting growth in investment.  Some firms, especially those operating in industries in which technological advances were spurring competition, were reportedly planning to expand capacity through mergers and acquisitions rather than through investment in new plant and equipment.  District contacts in regions affected by the hurricanes reported that the disruptions to production and sales were mostly short lived, including in the energy sector where drilling and refining outages were temporary.  Participants judged that increases in nonfarm payroll employment, apart from the temporary effects of the hurricanes, remained well above the pace likely to be sustainable in the longer run and that labor market conditions had strengthened further in recent months.  Participants also cited other indicators suggesting that labor market conditions continued to strengthen, including increases in the labor force participation rates of both prime age and all individuals.  Reports from some Districts pointed to difficulty attracting and retaining labor, but anecdotal information from other Districts suggested that workers with the requisite skills remained reasonably available.  Many participants judged that the economy was operating at or above full employment and anticipated that the labor market would tighten somewhat further in the near term, as GDP was expected to grow at a pace exceeding that of potential output.  A few participants interpreted recent data on aggregate wage and labor compensation as indicating some firming in wage growth; a few others, however, judged wage growth to have been little changed over the past year.  Reports from District contacts indicated that some businesses facing tight labor markets found it more effective to expand their workforces by using a variety of nonpecuniary means, including offering greater job flexibility and training, rather than by increasing wages.  Many participants judged that much of the recent softness in core inflation reflected temporary or idiosyncratic factors and that inflation would begin to rise once the influence of these factors began to wane.  In their comments regarding financial markets, participants generally judged that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the recent increases in the exchange value of the dollar and Treasury yields.  In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, several participants expressed concerns about a potential buildup of financial imbalances.  It was also observed that regulatory changes had contributed to an appreciable strengthening of capital and liquidity positions in the financial sector over recent years, increasing the resilience of the financial system to potential reversals in valuations.  A few participants mentioned the limited reaction in financial markets to the announcement and initial implementation of the Committee s plan for gradually reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings.  It was noted that, consistent with that limited response, market participants had characterized the Committee s communications regarding the balance sheet normalization program as clear and effective.  Several participants noted that the neutral level of the federal funds rate appeared to be quite low by historical standards.  Consistent with their expectation that a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation would be appropriate, many participants thought that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted in the near term if incoming information left the medium term outlook broadly unchanged.  Members reaffirmed their expectation that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  Nonetheless, they reiterated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  Balance sheet normalization was expected to proceed gradually, following the plan described in the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that the Committee released in June.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.

First, the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE declined in August and were revised down in June and July.  However, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth remained supportive of solid growth in real PCE.  FOMC communications over the intermeeting period reportedly were interpreted as indicating a somewhat slower pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than previously expected.  However, following news of an agreement to extend the debt ceiling by three months, rates on Treasury bills maturing in October retraced their entire increase from early in the intermeeting period.  Spreads on CMBS over Treasury securities narrowed a little over the intermeeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges of the past several years.  A couple of participants commented that competitive pressures and tight labor markets were increasing the incentives for businesses to substitute capital for labor or to invest in information technology.  Several of them noted that interpreting the next few inflation reports would likely be complicated by the temporary run up in energy costs and in the prices of other items affected by storm related disruptions and rebuilding.  Many participants viewed accommodative financial conditions, which had prevailed even as the Committee raised the federal funds rate, as likely to provide support for the economic expansion.

Finally, the manager reviewed details of the operational approach that the Open Market Desk planned to follow if the Committee decided at this meeting to initiate the proposal for SOMA reinvestment policy described in the Committee s June 2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  The decrease in August largely reflected the temporary effects of Hurricane Harvey on drilling, servicing, and extraction activity for oil and natural gas and on output in several manufacturing industries that are concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, including petroleum refining, organic chemicals, and plastics materials and resins.  Meanwhile, automakers assembly schedules suggested that motor vehicle production would move up, on balance, over the remainder of the year despite a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales in recent months.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining fell sharply in June and July, and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, leveled out in the past couple of months after increasing steadily for the past year.  Subprime auto loan balances have declined so far this year, partly reflecting the tighter lending standards, and the average credit score of all borrowers who obtained an auto loan in the second quarter remained near the upper end of its range of the past few years.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.  They expected growth of real GDP in the third quarter to be held down by the severe disruptions caused by the storms but to rebound beginning in the fourth quarter as rebuilding got under way and economic activity in the affected areas resumed.  Participants expected some fluctuations in consumer spending to result from the hurricanes, but they generally judged that consumption growth would continue to be supported by still solid fundamental determinants of household spending, including the income generated by the ongoing strength in the labor market, improved household balance sheets, and high levels of consumer confidence.  Sales of autos and light trucks had softened over the summer, leading producers to slow production to address a buildup of inventories, but a couple of participants noted that automakers expected to see a temporary increase in demand as households and businesses replaced vehicles damaged during the storms.  However, some participants still saw room for further increases in labor utilization, with a couple of them noting that the employment to population ratio and the participation rate for prime age workers had not fully recovered to pre recession levels.  However, reports from business contacts in several Districts indicated that employers in labor markets in which demand was high or in which workers in some occupations were in short supply were raising wages noticeably to compete for workers and limit turnover.  Most participants expected wage increases to pick up over time as the labor market strengthened further; a couple of participants cautioned that a broader acceleration in wages may already have begun, consistent with already tight labor market conditions.  In their discussion of monetary policy, all participants agreed that the economy had evolved broadly as they had anticipated at the time of the June meeting and that the incoming data had not materially altered the medium term economic outlook.  Consistent with the expectation that a gradual rise in the federal funds rate would be appropriate, many participants thought that another increase in the target range later this year was likely to be warranted if the medium term outlook remained broadly unchanged.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.

The increase in the FOMC s target range for the federal funds rate at the June meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates, and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the new target range over the intermeeting period except on quarter end.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in June, and the average monthly pace of private sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year.  The overall labor force participation rate edged up in June, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit.  Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in June, about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late 2016.  Automakers assembly schedules indicated that motor vehicle production would edge down again in the third quarter, likely reflecting a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales last quarter.  Much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods, which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year.  The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE declined in June but rose, on net, in the second quarter.  However, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth pointed to solid growth in total real PCE in the near term.  The issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to have increased moderately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first quarter.  Investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined further in May, and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, leveled out in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year.  Nominal outlays for defense through June pointed to an increase in real federal government purchases in the second quarter.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.  Market participants generally interpreted the information on reinvestment policy provided in June in the Committee s postmeeting statement and its Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans as consistent with their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy was likely to occur this year.  Overnight index swap rates pointed to little change in the expected path of the federal funds rate on net.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ticked up since the June FOMC meeting.  Despite their intermeeting period gains, longer term real and nominal Treasury yields remained very low by historical standards, apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long term neutral real interest rate over recent years.  Spreads of yields on investment and speculative grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable maturity Treasury securities narrowed a bit on net.  Conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period.  Financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available, al though debt issuance moderated.  Responses from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible, and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months.  The most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses, but banks also reported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources of external financing or to internally generated funds.  The pace of issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) through the first half of the year was similar to that seen last year.  Consumer credit continued to grow on a year over year basis, but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year.  Since the June FOMC meeting, the broad dollar depreciated 2 percent, weakening more against AFE currencies than against EME currencies.  Changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period European equities edged lower, Japanese equities were little changed, and EME equities increased.  European peripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the period, reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the outcomes of the French parliamentary election, Greek debt negotiations, and bank resolutions in Italy.  However, the effect of this change on the projection for real GDP over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer term interest rates.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.  These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.  Participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent, overall, with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed, on balance, since the June FOMC meeting.  Participants continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real GDP growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year.  Reports on the energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to expand, albeit more slowly than previously; survey evidence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in some locations at current oil prices.  In addition, a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected.  Participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period.  However, a few participants suggested that, in a tight labor market, measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers.  Still, most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  A couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels, although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.  Several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices, together with continued low longer term interest rates, had led to an easing of financial conditions.  It was noted that financial stability assessments were based on current capital levels within the banking sector, and that such assessments would likely be adjusted should these measures of loss absorbing capacity change.  Participants underscored the need to monitor financial institutions for shifts in behavior such as an erosion of lending standards or increased reliance on unstable sources of funding that could lead to subsequent problems.  Participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory tools developed since the financial crisis had played an important role in fostering financial stability.  Participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.  Participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  This participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely strike the appropriate balance between promoting the Committee s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.  Participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings that was announced in June in the Committee s postmeeting statement and its Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.  They expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  They also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  Several members observed that, in part because of the Committee s various communications regarding the change, any reaction in financial markets to such a change would likely be limited.  The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1 1/4 percent.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  The Committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated; this program is described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.","id":51},{"text":" Starts of new single family homes edged up in April, but the issuance of building permits for these homes declined somewhat.

In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately, on average, so far this year.  Participants again noted the uncertainty regarding the possible enactment, timing, and nature of changes to fiscal and other government policies and saw both upside and downside risks to the economic outlook associated with such changes.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, some participants emphasized downside risks, particularly in light of the recent low readings on inflation along with measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations that were still low.","id":52},{"text":" Survey results and market pricing suggested that market participants saw a high probability of an increase in the FOMC s target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The deputy manager reviewed survey results on market expectations for SOMA reinvestment policy and for the evolution of the System s balance sheet over coming years.  The March data, together with revised estimates for earlier months, indicated that real exports grew briskly in the first quarter and at a faster pace than in the second half of 2016.  Likewise, the medians of longer run inflation expectations from the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were essentially unchanged in June.  Commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks books grew robustly in April and May, with nonfarm nonresidential loans leading the expansion.  Participants generally continued to expect that ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, and improved household balance sheets would support moderate growth in household spending over the medium term.  District contacts suggested that an expansion in oil production capacity was likely to continue in the near term, though the longer term outlook was more uncertain.  However, some other participants suggested that they did not see the balance sheet normalization program as a factor likely to figure heavily in decisions about the target range for the federal funds rate.  These participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.","id":52},{"text":" The spread between the three month London interbank offered rate and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate had narrowed markedly in recent months after rising noticeably in advance of the implementation of money market fund reform in the fall of 2016.  She noted that participants appeared to have reached a consensus on an approach that involved specifying caps on the monthly amount of principal payments from securities holdings that would not be reinvested; these caps would rise over the period of a year, after which they would remain constant.  As anticipated, growth in consumer spending seemed to have bounced back from a weak first quarter, and participants continued to expect that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector in several Districts were reportedly strong, but activity in a couple of them had slowed in recent months from a high level, and some contacts in the automobile industry reported declines in production that they expected to continue in the near term.  Most participants viewed the recent softness in these price data as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors, including sharp declines in prices of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs, and expected these developments to have little bearing on inflation over the medium run.  Some participants suggested that increased risk tolerance among investors might be contributing to elevated asset prices more broadly; a few participants expressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of risks to financial stability.  One participant did not believe it was appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target range at this meeting; this participant suggested that the Committee should maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 1 percent until the inflation rate was actually moving toward the Committee s 2 percent longer run objective.  With regard to financial stability, one participant emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant about financial developments but observed that previous episodes of elevated financial imbalances and low unemployment had limited relevance for the present situation, as the current system of financial regulation was likely more robust than that prevailing before the financial crisis.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.  They expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and they agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

A few participants also judged that the case for a policy rate increase at this meeting was strengthened by the easing, by some measures, in overall financial conditions over the previous six months.

Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.

Members agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run.","id":53},{"text":" By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  Several participants noted that surveys of business conditions in their Districts continued to indicate expanding activity.  Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined.","id":53},{"text":" These changes reportedly reflected revisions to investors expectations for fiscal and other economic policies; some increase in geopolitical tensions; economic and inflation indicators that, on balance, were weaker than anticipated; and monetary policy communications.  Quotes on overnight index swap (OIS) rates pointed to a flattening of the expected path of the federal funds rate through 2020, but a staff model suggested that a reduction in term premiums accounted for about half the decline in OIS rates.  Treasury bills outstanding, which had declined before the reimposition of the federal debt ceiling on March 15, moved higher thereafter, partly in connection with the Treasury s steps to rebuild its cash balance.  It was noted that much of the recent slowing likely reflected transitory factors, such as low consumer spending for energy services induced by an unusually mild winter and a decline in motor vehicle sales from an unsustainably high fourth quarter pace.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity had slowed.

Policymakers also discussed the potential benefits and costs of approaches that would either phase out or cease all at once reinvestments of principal from these securities.  Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017.  The Committee s decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the January February FOMC meeting was well anticipated.  The delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools had risen since the spring of 2016, reflecting increased delinquencies on loans originated before the financial crisis.","id":54},{"text":" In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained at an elevated level in February.

Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.","id":54},{"text":" Inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) continued to rise, largely reflecting increases in retail energy prices and currency depreciation.  In view of the substantial uncertainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projections.  This increase was viewed as appropriate in light of the further progress that had been made toward the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","id":54},{"text":" These briefings discussed the macroeconomic implications of alternative strategies the Committee could employ with respect to reinvestments, including making the timing of an end to reinvestments either date dependent or dependent on economic conditions.  Moreover, it was noted that the Committee s policy of maintaining reinvestments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way had supported the smooth and effective conduct of monetary policy and had helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.  An approach that phased out reinvestments was seen as reducing the risks of triggering financial market volatility or of potentially sending misleading signals about the Committee s policy intentions while only modestly slowing reductions in the Committee s securities holdings.  To promote rapid normalization of the size and composition of the balance sheet, one participant preferred to set a minimum pace for reductions in MBS holdings and, if and when necessary, to sell MBS to maintain such a pace.  Real GDP was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter.  The downside risks from the possibility that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace.  A number of participants also cited buoyant consumer confidence as potentially supporting household expenditures, al though some also mentioned that improved sentiment did not appear to have appreciably altered the trajectory of consumer spending so far.  Members generally noted that the increase in the target range did not reflect changes in their assessments of the economic outlook or the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, adding that the increase was consistent with the gradual pace of removal of accommodation that was anticipated in December, when the Committee last raised the target range.  Partly in light of the likelihood that the recent higher readings on headline inflation had mostly reflected the temporary effect of increases in consumer energy prices, members agreed that the Committee would continue to carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its inflation goal.  The Committee decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities.

Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  The Committee considered amendments to its Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants and its Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff.  The revised proposal was based on further analysis and consultations following Committee discussion of a proposal at the January 2016 meeting.  Participants generally supported the revised approach and agreed that fan charts would be incorporated in the SEP to be released with the minutes of the March 14 15, 2017, FOMC meeting.  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The SOMA manager reported on developments in United States and global financial markets during the period since the Committee met on December 13 14, 2016.  Emerging market currencies were generally resilient in recent weeks, reportedly benefiting from investors anticipation of stronger global economic growth, after depreciating significantly against the dollar during the previous intermeeting period.  In money markets, interest rates smoothly shifted higher following the Committee s decision at its December meeting to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and federal funds subsequently traded near the center of the new range except on year end.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Consumer price inflation rose further above the slow pace seen during the first half of last year, but it was still running below the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent.  The employment cost index for private industry workers rose 2 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in December, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased almost 3 percent over the same 12 month period.  The output of utilities declined, as the weather was unseasonably warm, on average, during the fourth quarter.  However, consumer spending for energy services declined markedly, reflecting unseasonably warm weather.  Recent readings on some key factors that influence consumer spending including further gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth were consistent with moderate increases in real PCE in early 2017.  Real residential investment spending rose at a brisk pace in the fourth quarter after decreasing in the previous two quarters.  Recent increases in nominal new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, along with improvements in indicators of business sentiment, pointed to further moderate increases in real E I spending in the near term.  Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures declined in the fourth quarter after rising in the previous quarter.  Nominal imports in November rose to their highest level of the year, led by imports of industrial supplies and materials.  Altogether, the change in real net exports was estimated to have made a substantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  Survey based measures of median longer run inflation expectations such as those from the Michigan survey and from the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were unchanged, on net, over December and January.  Foreign real GDP growth appeared to slow somewhat in the fourth quarter from its relatively strong third quarter pace.  Nevertheless, recent data on foreign industrial production and trade seemed to be stronger than private analysts had anticipated and were consistent with moderate economic growth abroad.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial conditions were mostly little changed, on balance, since the December FOMC meeting.  Broad equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively narrow range and ended the intermeeting period about unchanged.  Nominal Treasury yields moved up across most maturities in the days following the December FOMC meeting but subsequently reversed and ended the period little changed on net.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) rose somewhat on balance.  Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative.  Nonetheless, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures quotes was little changed, on net, since the December meeting.  Market based estimates indicated that investors saw the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the January 31 February 1 FOMC meeting as very low, and the estimated probability of an increase in the target range at or before the March meeting was about 25 percent.  Market based estimates of the probability of an increase in the target range at or before the June meeting were about 70 percent.  Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased across most maturities following the December FOMC meeting, but they fell, on balance, over the remainder of the intermeeting period.  While market commentary suggested that a number of factors contributed to the decline, a clear catalyst was difficult to identify.  Broad United States equity price indexes fluctuated in a relatively narrow range and were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  However, equity prices remained notably higher than just before the November elections, apparently reflecting investors expectations that fiscal and other policy changes would boost corporate profits and economic activity in the medium term.  Corporate bond spreads for both investment and speculative grade firms continued to narrow over the intermeeting period and were near the bottom of their ranges of the past several years.  Money market rates responded as expected to the change in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The effective federal funds rate was 66 basis points 25 basis points higher than previously every day following the change, except at year end.  Conditions in other domestic short term funding markets were generally stable over the intermeeting period.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses continued to be accommodative overall.  Corporate bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in December to about its robust average pace of the past few years, and issuance of syndicated leveraged loans was strong.  The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks left C I lending standards for large and middle market firms and for small firms unchanged, on balance, in the fourth quarter.  Mortgage credit was broadly available to households with average to high credit scores, while credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard to document income, or high debt to income ratios.  The interest rate on 30 year fixed rate mortgages moved about in line with rates on comparable maturity Treasury securities, rising notably after the November elections but retracing part of that increase since mid December.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally accommodative, although lending standards for credit cards continued to be tight for subprime borrowers.  In contrast, the dollar strengthened further against the Mexican peso over the intermeeting period.  In addition, with money market fund reforms in place, the vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation were viewed as being somewhat below their longer run average.  Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic projection prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting, the near term forecast was little changed from the December meeting.  The staff s forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was little changed.  Participants generally indicated that their economic forecasts had changed little since the December FOMC meeting.  Participants again emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the prospects for changes in fiscal and other government policies as well as about the timing and magnitude of the net effects of such changes on economic activity.  Regarding the household sector, consumer spending posted a moderate increase in the fourth quarter, and participants generally anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute importantly to economic growth in 2017.  They expected that, although interest rates had moved higher, household spending would continue to be supported by rising employment and income as well as high levels of household wealth.  The recent improvement in consumer sentiment was also viewed as a potentially positive factor in the outlook for spending, although several participants cautioned that an elevated level of sentiment, even if it was sustained, was likely to make only a small contribution to household spending beyond those from income, wealth, and credit conditions.  Starts and permits for single family housing and sales of existing homes rose moderately in the fourth quarter, and real residential investment bounced back after two quarterly declines.  The outlook for the business sector improved further over the intermeeting period.  The available reports from District surveys of activity and revenues in the manufacturing and services industries were very positive.  Many participants indicated that their business contacts attributed the improvement in business sentiment to the expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies.  In addition, contacts in some industries remained concerned that their businesses might be adversely affected by some of the government policy changes being considered.  Activity in the energy sector continued to improve, with District contacts reporting an increase in capital spending, better access to credit, and a pickup in hiring.  Monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 165,000 over the period from October to December, a pace that, if it continued, would be expected to increase labor utilization over time.  Moreover, several participants business contacts reported shortages of workers in some occupations or the need for training programs to expand the supply of skilled workers.  Several other participants thought that some margins of labor underutilization remained, citing the still high rate of prime age workers outside the labor force, the elevated share of workers who were employed part time for economic reasons, or the potential for further firming in labor force participation.  Some market based measures of inflation compensation had turned up noticeably in late 2016, but a number of participants noted that they remained relatively low.  A few participants commented that the recent increase in equity prices might in part reflect investors anticipation of a boost to earnings from a cut in corporate taxes or more expansionary fiscal policy, which might not materialize.  Recent reforms had diminished the risk of runs on or by prime money market funds.  Several participants emphasized that the increased resilience of the financial system since the financial crisis had importantly been the result of the key safety and soundness reforms put in place in recent years.  However, having additional macroprudential tools could prove useful in addressing problems that could arise in real estate financing or in the shadow banking sector.  Participants discussed whether their current assessments of economic conditions and the medium term outlook warranted altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate.  Against this backdrop, they thought it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent at this meeting.  Finally, the view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate were likely to be appropriate also reflected the assessment that the neutral real rate defined as the real interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating at or near its potential was currently quite low and was likely to rise only slowly over time.  Participants emphasized that the Committee might need to change its communications regarding the anticipated path for the policy rate if economic conditions evolved differently than the Committee expected or if the economic outlook changed.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had continued to expand at a moderate pace.  The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels expected to prevail in the longer run.  Members noted that this policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.

Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180,000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year.

Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax, and regulatory policies, while others were uncertain about the outlook for significant government policy changes or were concerned that their businesses might be adversely affected by some of the proposals under discussion.

The FOMC might instead target an overnight Treasury repurchase agreement rate and use standing facilities to keep repurchase agreement rates close to the target level.  The most recent construction data were mixed, with starts for new single family homes increasing in September and starts for multifamily units declining sharply.  Import growth was driven by higher imports of capital goods and services, while export growth was led in part by higher exports of industrial supplies and automotive products.  Some participants characterized wage pressures as only moderate, although one noted that wage growth was similar to its pace at the peak of the previous economic expansion.","id":57},{"text":" Such an approach could also be effective with an appreciably smaller balance sheet and supply of reserves than at present.

Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year.  In particular, accumulating evidence of slow trend productivity and output growth and associated persistently low levels of neutral interest rates, both in the United States and abroad, had potential implications for the most effective policy implementation framework for the Federal Reserve in coming years as well as the monetary policy strategy that would best promote the Committee s macroeconomic objectives.  In addition, many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital.  The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.

The labor force participation rate for white individuals aged 25 to 54 continued to be higher than for African Americans and for Hispanics, but the rates for all three groups appeared to have either moved sideways or edged up recently.  Over the previous two years, manufacturing output was relatively flat, reflecting the effects of weak export demand, spillovers from the earlier declines in crude oil and natural gas drilling, and slow domestic capital investment more generally.  Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures increased in the third quarter, and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, continued to edge up in October.  The European Central Bank kept its policy stance unchanged at its October meeting while signaling that further changes to its asset purchase program could be announced at its next meeting.  Based on the relatively limited information received since the September FOMC meeting, participants generally agreed that the case for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate had continued to strengthen.  Most participants expressed a view that it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon, so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee s objectives.","id":57},{"text":" The deputy manager followed with a briefing on open market operations and developments in money markets, including investment flows and changes in market interest rates in anticipation of the upcoming implementation of reforms to the money market fund (MMF) industry.  The employment to population ratio for individuals aged 25 to 64 continued to be higher for whites than for African Americans and for Hispanics.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were consistent with solid real PCE growth for the third quarter as a whole, including continued gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth.  Building permit issuance for new single family homes which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction was little changed, on balance, in recent months and was essentially flat since late last year.  However, new orders for these capital goods rose substantially in July and were notably above the level of shipments, suggesting a pickup in business spending for equipment in the near term.  The limited information available suggested that the change in inventory investment would be positive in the third quarter after subtracting substantially from real GDP growth in the second quarter.  After rising in June, imports retraced some of this gain in July, driven by lower imports of consumer goods and capital goods.  Anticipation of the impending deadline for compliance with MMF reform measures continued to prompt net outflows from prime MMFs and put upward pressure on some term money market rates.  Spreads on yields of both investment grade and high yield nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on comparable maturity Treasury securities declined somewhat to levels fairly close to their historical norms.  Reflecting MMFs reduced appetite for term lending, spreads of three month money market rates over rates on comparable maturity overnight index swap contracts rose during the intermeeting period.  The overall credit quality of the nonfinancial corporate sector, which had deteriorated a bit over the past few quarters, showed signs of stabilizing over the intermeeting period.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) left its policy rates unchanged at its July meeting and instead expanded its purchases of exchange traded stock funds and introduced additional measures to facilitate dollar funding.  Volatility in domestic and global asset markets was relatively low over most of the intermeeting period, and United States financial conditions were broadly accommodative.  Growth in consumer spending appeared to have moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its rapid second quarter pace, reflecting a softening in retail sales since June.  They saw consumer spending as likely to be supported by a number of factors, including ongoing job gains, rising household income and wealth, improved household balance sheets, and buoyant consumer sentiment.  Economic activity in the second half of the year was expected to be buoyed in part by a pickup in business fixed investment and some rebuilding of inventories.  Participants generally agreed that labor market conditions had improved appreciably over the course of the year, with monthly payroll gains averaging about 180,000.  Participants commented on a staff analysis showing differential patterns of unemployment across racial and ethnic groups that remained after taking education into account; it was suggested that it might be worthwhile to examine such issues further.  A few participants expressed concern that the protracted period of very low interest rates might be encouraging excessive borrowing and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector.","id":58},{"text":" Over much of the period, financial market volatility was relatively low, but volatility increased somewhat in the last couple of weeks of the period amid shifting views among market participants about potential monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 20 21 meeting indicated that labor market conditions strengthened in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) was increasing at a faster pace in the third quarter than in the first half of the year.  Although automakers assembly schedules pointed to some increase in motor vehicle production in the near term, broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as new orders diffusion indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, suggested that factory output would remain on a flat trajectory in the coming months.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period suggested that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year.  Inflation was expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.  Al though job gains had slowed from their pace in 2015, average monthly increases so far this year had exceeded most estimates discussed by participants of monthly payroll increases that could be expected to prevail with economic growth proceeding at its longer run trend rate.  Participants discussed the implications of a fall in longer run r for monetary policy, including the possibility that policy interest rates might be closer to the effective lower bound more frequently and for a long period, or that monetary policy was ill equipped to address structural factors such as the decline in productivity growth.  Some participants believed that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened, while some others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee s 2 percent objective.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in July indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity had picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year.  The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  A few others, however, emphasized that decisions regarding near term adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain data dependent and expressed some concern that the new sentence might be misread as indicating that the passage of time rather than the accumulation of evidence would be the key factor in the Committee s decisions at future meetings.  The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.

The output of the mining sector increased since April after having trended down from late 2014.  Recent information on housing activity suggested that real residential investment spending continued to be soft in the third quarter.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased in June and July.  The Michigan survey measure of median longer run inflation expectations edged down in August and was unchanged in early September.  Staff Review of Financial Situation Domestic financial conditions remained accommodative since the July FOMC meeting.  The European Central Bank left its policy rates and asset purchase program unchanged at its September meeting.  Household spending had been growing strongly but business fixed investment had remained soft.  However, the sluggishness in the housing sector appeared to have continued into the third quarter.  Reports from several Districts indicated widespread increases in employment over the intermeeting period.  Participants generally agreed that the case for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate had strengthened in recent months.  Many of them, however, expressed the view that recent evidence suggested that some slack remained in the labor market.

While total assets under the management of MMFs changed little over the intermeeting period, investors continued to shift from prime funds to government funds.  Announcements by foreign central banks garnered investor attention and contributed to somewhat higher asset price volatility later in the period.  At its early August meeting, the Bank of England announced a rate cut, a resumption of its asset purchase program, and a new bank funding program.  Longer term U.K. yields and the pound fell immediately following the announcement but retraced these declines following better than expected economic data later in the period.

Equity price indexes increased, on net, despite an initial sharp decline following the Brexit vote, and corporate bond spreads declined on balance.  Businesses in the energy industry were reported to be highly leveraged, and additional restructurings and bankruptcies were seen as likely.  Inflation continued to run below the Committee s 2 percent longer run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non energy imports.","id":59},{"text":" The expected policy path implied by market quotes fell further in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but it later retraced most of the earlier declines, supported by better than expected domestic data releases particularly the employment and retail sales reports for June as well as improved sentiment regarding the possible near term implications of Brexit.

The increase seemed to be in part the result of shifts in investments by money market funds in advance of the scheduled implementation in October of changes to the regulation of the money market fund industry.  Total United States consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, partly restrained by earlier declines in consumer energy prices.  Immediately after the Brexit vote, the British pound depreciated sharply against other major currencies, while the United States dollar and the Japanese yen strengthened on what appeared to be safe haven flows.  Emerging market asset prices were generally resilient over the intermeeting period; the dollar was weaker against most emerging market currencies, and flows into emerging market assets surged.  Activity in the manufacturing sector continued to be mixed Several participants indicated that manufacturing in their Districts was still quite weak, while several others reported that their Banks June surveys showed that manufacturing activity had picked up or stabilized.  Some indicated that a step down in monthly job gains seemed appropriate as labor market conditions approached those consistent with the Committee s maximum employment objective and that a more moderate pace of hiring could still be consistent with further increases in labor utilization.  However, several others were concerned that if labor market slack diminished more slowly than they had previously anticipated, progress on the Committee s maximum employment and inflation objectives could be delayed.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions.","id":59},{"text":" A similar pattern among demographic groups held for a broader measure of labor underutilization that also includes persons who were marginally attached to the labor force and those who were employed part time for economic reasons.  The apparent pickup in real PCE growth was consistent with recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending, including continued gains in real disposable personal income and in households net worth.  Residential investment posted a strong increase in the first quarter of the year, but data on starts of new single family homes indicated that outlays likely edged down in the second quarter.","id":59},{"text":" Overall, negative sentiment surrounding the Brexit outcome early in the intermeeting period was subsequently alleviated by expectations for greater policy accommodation in some AFEs, some resolution of near term political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and positive United States economic data releases.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial conditions remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.  However, broad based market dislocations did not develop, apparently because market participants had prepared for a significant risk event.  Longer term nominal Treasury yields fell sharply in the two weeks following the Brexit vote.  Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Declines in European bank stock prices following the Brexit vote also reversed later in the intermeeting period.  Overall financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative.  Meanwhile, CMBS delinquency rates edged up for the third consecutive month.  The unsuccessful coup attempt in Turkey on July 15 left little imprint on global financial markets.  Household spending had been growing strongly, but business fixed investment had been soft.  Participants generally indicated that their economic forecasts had changed little over the intermeeting period.  The available surveys indicated that service sector activity continued to expand.  The sharp rebound in payroll employment gains put the average monthly increase in jobs over the three months ending in June at about 150,000.  Participants also discussed recent developments in financial markets and issues related to financial stability.  Members agreed that household spending had been growing strongly but business fixed investment had been soft.  The first was about the outlook for the labor market.  Many members commented on the somewhat slower average pace of improvement in labor market conditions in recent months.

Over the first two months of the second quarter, both the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio moved down on net.  Also, consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained upbeat in early June.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial market conditions remained accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Credit also remained broadly available to households, except for higher risk borrowers in some markets.  Overall financing conditions for nonfinancial firms improved a bit over the intermeeting period, remaining accommodative.  Expected year ahead default rates for nonfinancial firms remained moderately elevated relative to previous expansions, while those for oil companies continued to be high.  Growth of consumer spending appeared to have picked up from its slow pace in the first quarter.  Participants summarized survey readings and anecdotal reports on business conditions in their Districts.  Regarding the service sector, a few participants commented that activity and hiring continued to expand in their Districts.  Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market.  Participants generally expected to see a resumption of monthly gains in payroll employment that would be sufficient to promote continued strengthening of the labor market.

A few pointed out that with inflation likely to remain low for some time and to rise only gradually, maintaining an accommodative stance of policy could extend the strengthening of the labor market.  Some of them judged that labor market conditions were now at or close to the Committee s objectives and pointed out that some moderation in employment gains was to be expected when such conditions were near those consistent with maximum employment.","id":60},{"text":" Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 14 15 meeting indicated that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions slowed in April and May but that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising faster than in the first quarter.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the pace of improvement in the labor market had slowed while growth in economic activity appeared to have picked up.  They judged that their decisions about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate in coming months would depend importantly on whether incoming information corroborated the Committee s expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.  The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.","id":60},{"text":" The probability of an increase in June fell to near zero in early May in response to incoming economic data, jumped to about 30 percent after the release of the April FOMC minutes and other Federal Reserve communications, and dropped again to near zero after the May employment report.  Measures of inflation compensation based on inflation swaps also declined, but less than TIPS based measures, consistent with anecdotal reports suggesting that a portion of the declines in TIPS based measures might have been driven by elevated demand for longer term nominal Treasury securities.  Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was estimated to have been faster in the first quarter than in the April forecast, and the incoming information was consistent with a moderate pickup in GDP growth in the second quarter.  Most participants judged that, in the absence of significant economic or financial shocks, raising the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate if incoming information confirmed that economic growth had picked up, that job gains were continuing at a pace sufficient to sustain progress toward the Committee s maximum employment objective, and that inflation was likely to rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Committee Policy Action In their consideration of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in April indicated that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed in recent months while growth in economic activity appeared to have picked up from the low rates recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.  However, other members observed that the recent soft readings on payroll jobs as well as the decline in the labor force participation rate and the absence of further reductions in the number of individuals who were working part time for economic reasons in recent months suggested a possible downshift in the pace of improvement in the labor market.  Members expected inflation to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but most anticipated that inflation would rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further.  The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated doing so until normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way.

Some participants indicated that consumption was likely to continue being supported by these factors, which included ongoing gains in income, robust household balance sheets, and the positive assessment of current economic conditions that was evident in recent surveys of consumers.  These indicators included a number of regional surveys of labor market conditions, relatively low levels of initial claims for unemployment insurance, surveys of business hiring plans, and positive views of labor market conditions in recent consumer surveys.  Several noted that in the prevailing circumstances of considerable uncertainty about the neutral federal funds rate, the Committee could better gauge the effects of increases in the federal funds rate on the economy if it proceeded gradually in adjusting policy.","id":60},{"text":" Risk sentiment also appeared to improve further, on net, accompanied by a decline in financial market volatility and higher oil prices.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the April 26 27 FOMC meeting indicated that labor market conditions improved further in the first quarter even though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed.  Sales of existing homes rose in March after decreasing in February, while new home sales moved lower in both months; nonetheless, sales of both new and existing homes in the first quarter as a whole were above those in the fourth quarter.  In the Survey of Market Participants, the median investor s modal path for the federal funds rate also moved down substantially, while in the Survey of Primary Dealers, the median dealer s modal path was little changed.  More broadly, several participants commented that their business contacts had expressed considerable caution about the economic outlook or had indicated that their firms were focused on cost cutting measures that included delaying major expenditures, despite relatively favorable financial conditions.  Some participants pointed to the risk that the recent weak data on domestic spending could reflect a loss of momentum in the economy that might hinder further gains in the labor market and raise the likelihood that inflation could fail to increase as expected.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that labor market conditions had improved further even as growth in economic activity had appeared to slow.

Experience during the intermeeting period continued to suggest that the operational framework for monetary policy implementation was effective in maintaining control over the federal funds rate.  The deputy manager also outlined factors that the Committee might consider in determining whether to offer term reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) over the end of the first quarter.  For these reasons, Committee participants generally preferred not to offer term RRPs over the end of the first quarter.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down in January and February.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending generally pointed toward solid growth in real PCE over the first half of the year.  Sales of existing homes increased further in January following a strong gain in December.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased somewhat in January after having declined for two months.  The limited available data suggested that inventory investment continued to decline in the early part of the year.  Nominal construction spending by state and local governments increased sharply in January, but the payrolls of these governments were little changed, on net, over the first two months of the year.  Concerns about persistently low inflation spurred further monetary policy accommodation by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB).  Financing conditions for investment grade nonfinancial firms continued to be relatively accommodative.  The default rate on nonfinancial bonds remained somewhat elevated compared with typical levels outside recession periods.  Lending conditions in residential real estate markets were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained accommodative, and outstanding student and auto debt continued to grow at a robust pace.  Since the January FOMC meeting, the dollar depreciated, on net, against most foreign currencies.  Long term sovereign bond yields declined notably in the advanced economies, in part as foreign central banks announced additional monetary policy easing measures.  The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was also roughly unchanged, on net, since the December meeting.  Household spending had been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector had improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports had been soft.  A range of labor market indicators, including strong employment growth and rising labor force participation, pointed to a further strengthening of the labor market.  Subsequently, investor sentiment rebounded, and domestic and global financial conditions eased on net over the intermeeting period.  Participants observed that strong job gains in recent months had reduced concerns about a possible slowing of progress in the labor market.  Continued increases in household spending had buoyed growth of overall aggregate demand despite the volatility in financial markets.  Among the various categories of household spending, participants noted that motor vehicle sales remained particularly strong, albeit with some support from price discounting and other incentives.  Reports on the housing sector were mixed, with some participants noting a weakening of housing activity in regions adversely affected by the decline in energy prices.  Some participants reported that contacts were generally upbeat about the outlook for housing construction in their Districts, and participants anticipated that activity in the housing sector would continue to expand this year.  In contrast, several participants noted recent softness in business fixed investment and signs that the sluggish growth would continue.  The possible adverse effects on investment spending of concerns about global growth and the associated volatility in financial markets were also noted.  In discussing domestic business conditions, several participants noted that their contacts saw rising sales in the retail sector and that reports from firms in the services sector were mostly strong.  In some Districts, surveys suggested that manufacturing activity had bottomed out.  Broader measures of labor force underutilization had also shown progress, including an increase in labor force participation.  The surprisingly limited extent to which aggregate data indicated upward pressure on wage growth also suggested some remaining slack in labor markets.  Some survey based measures had edged down, while others had remained stable and one had edged up; such measures were little changed, on balance, in recent months.  Taking these developments into account, participants generally judged that the medium term outlook for domestic demand was not appreciably different than it had been when the Committee met in December.  Several participants also cited wider credit spreads as a factor that was likely to restrain growth in demand.  A number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly.  They also agreed that household spending had been increasing at a moderate rate, and that the housing sector had improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports had been soft.  Indeed, several members noted that their current projections of the path for the federal funds rate that would likely be appropriate this year and next were lower than they had projected in December.  Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent.","id":62},{"text":" Participants noted that it may be appropriate to offer term RRPs at some point in the future after the Committee reintroduces an aggregate cap on ON RRP operations, and the Committee s decisions regarding term RRPs over quarter ends had no implications for the FOMC s plan to phase out the ON RRP facility when it was no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  Manufacturing output rose, reversing the declines seen in the two previous months, and the output of utilities moved up sharply as the demand for heating rebounded after having been held down by unseasonably warm weather in December.  Survey measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, Blue Chip Economic Indicators, Survey of Professional Forecasters, Survey of Primary Dealers, and Survey of Market Participants were generally little changed on balance.  Yields on 5 and 10 year nominal Treasury securities declined at the outset of the intermeeting period, reflecting the continued pullback from risky assets that began early in the year on concerns about prospects for global economic growth.  Reflecting the improvement in investor sentiment that started in mid February, corporate bond spreads narrowed, with spreads on investment grade issues finishing the period slightly lower while spreads on speculative grade issues particularly those for the lowest rated bonds declined appreciably.  Beyond the near term, real GDP was expected to increase slightly faster than in the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices and a lower assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Many participants, however, anticipated that relative strength in household spending would be partially offset by weakness in net exports associated with lackluster foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar since mid 2014.  Some participants judged that current labor market conditions were at or near those consistent with maximum sustainable employment, noting that the unemployment rate was at or below their estimates of its longer run normal level and citing anecdotal reports of labor shortages or increased wage pressures.  Some noted that recent financial market turbulence provided an important reminder that the ability of central banks to offset the effects of adverse economic shocks might be limited, particularly by the low level of policy interest rates in most advanced economies.  Participants generally agreed that the incoming information indicated that the United States economy had been resilient to recent global economic and financial developments, and that the domestic economic indicators that had become available in recent weeks had been mostly consistent with their expectations.  These participants saw their judgment as consistent with the Committee s data dependent approach to setting monetary policy; it was noted that, in this context, the relevant data include not only domestic economic releases, but also information about developments abroad and changes in financial conditions that bear on the economic outlook.  In light of this expectation and their assessment of the risks to the economic outlook, several expressed the view that a cautious approach to raising rates would be prudent or noted their concern that raising the target range as soon as April would signal a sense of urgency they did not think appropriate.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.  The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.

Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  The deputy manager followed with a briefing on money market developments and System open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Committee met on December 15 16, 2015.  The report included an assessment of the response of money market interest rates to the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate announced following the December meeting.  Take up of overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations over this period was consistent with that observed in the testing phase of operations over the second half of last year.  The deputy manager also reviewed plans for reinvestment of the proceeds of upcoming maturations of SOMA holdings of Treasury securities, for small value tests of various System operations and facilities during 2016, and for quarterly tests of the Term Deposit Facility.  The Committee then resumed its consideration of matters related to the System s reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) facilities, focusing in particular on the appropriate aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility going forward.  A staff presentation at this meeting reviewed broad strategies for reintroducing an aggregate cap on ON RRP operations and managing the cap subsequently.  Some noted that the demand for ON RRPs could be reduced by widening the spread between the interest rate on reserves and the offering rate on ON RRPs.  Finally, policymakers also discussed the appropriate management of the Federal Reserve s RRP operations over quarter ends, when private sector cash investment options temporarily and predictably decline and result in temporary downward pressure on some money market rates, including the federal funds rate.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 26 27 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to improve in the fourth quarter of last year even though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to slow.  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in December, and the monthly pace of job gains in the fourth quarter as a whole was faster than in the third quarter.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons moved down a bit in December.  The four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was somewhat higher in early January than its very low level late last year.  Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, about 1/2 percentage point more than over the same period a year earlier.  Manufacturing output declined, with a step down in the production of motor vehicles and parts from the high levels seen earlier last year, while production outside of the motor vehicle sector was roughly flat.  Automakers assembly schedules and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, mostly pointed to a slow pace of gains in factory output early this year.  Moreover, in December the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE edged down, and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles, while remaining at a high level, declined.  Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products looked to be slower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.  Forward looking indicators of equipment spending, such as new orders for nondefense capital goods along with recent readings from national and regional surveys of business conditions, generally pointed to soft business equipment spending in the coming months.  Indicators of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector, such as the number of oil and gas rigs in operation, continued to fall through early January.  The available information indicated that inventory investment decreased again in the fourth quarter, although there was little evidence that inventory to sales ratios were uncomfortably high outside of the energy sector.  State and local government payrolls increased somewhat in the fourth quarter, while nominal construction spending by these governments declined in October and November.  In early January, the Michigan survey measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years ticked up but continued to run near the low end of its typical range of the past 15 years.  Lower oil prices and the slowing in United States manufacturing activity contributed to a step down in the rate of economic growth in Mexico.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as turmoil in Chinese financial markets and lower oil prices contributed to concerns about pros pects for global economic growth and a pullback from risky assets.  Treasury yields declined across maturities, reflecting a downward revision in the expected path of the federal funds rate and likely some increase in safe haven demands amid the market turbulence.  Part of the decline likely also reflected an increase in safe haven demands for low risk and highly liquid assets amid the turbulence in financial markets.  Broad United States equity price indexes declined sharply over the intermeeting period, exhibiting a high correlation with movements in crude oil prices and foreign equity indexes.  Spreads on corporate bonds over comparable maturity Treasury securities widened over the intermeeting period, reportedly reflecting increased concerns about corporate credit quality, particularly in the energy sector, and a decline in investors willingness to assume risk.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative for firms of higher credit quality but tightened somewhat for riskier firms.  Credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard to document income, or high debt to income ratios.  According to the January SLOOS, moderate net fractions of banks eased standards on several types of home mortgages over the past three months and expected to ease standards this year.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative on balance.  Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace in the fourth quarter, reflecting further expansions in credit card, auto, and student loan balances.  The foreign exchange value of the United States dollar appreciated further against most currencies, with larger increases relative to the currencies of commodity exporting countries.  Their assessment reflected strong capital and liquidity positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued borrowing by households.  The high leverage of nonfinancial corporations and the liquidity mismatch at high yield bond mutual funds suggested some elevated risks for bond investors and lower rated borrowers.  Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been markedly slower than in the forecast for the December meeting.  Energy prices and the prices of non energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year.  Household and business spending had been increasing at moderate rates; however, net exports had been soft and inventory investment had slowed.  In considering the outlook for economic activity, participants weighed the divergent signals from recent strength in the labor market and the modest increase in real GDP suggested by the available data on spending and production.  In assessing the medium term outlook, participants discussed the extent to which the recent turbulence in global financial markets might restrain United States economic activity.  They continued to anticipate that economic activity would expand at a moderate pace over the medium term and that the labor market would continue to strengthen.  Moreover, households spending on energy services was evidently held down by unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country.  Although participants received mixed reports from their District contacts on consumer spending, some heard that retail activity had been generally positive at year end, and a number of participants relayed indications that spending on services in their Districts remained solid.  Because of these favorable fundamentals, many participants indicated that they still expected consumer spending to contribute importantly to economic growth in the coming year.  Nonetheless, a couple of others pointed out that information from surveys of consumer sentiment suggested that households, to date, had not appeared to be particularly sensitive to changes in financial market conditions.  Participants from those Reserve Banks that conduct surveys of manufacturing activity reported that the weakness extended into January.  Nonetheless, several participants pointed to aerospace, autos, and consumer products as areas of strength in the manufacturing sector, and a few commented that manufacturers surveyed in their Districts were still relatively optimistic about the outlook for 2016.  Commercial construction was reported to be strong in a couple of Districts, and a few participants commented that government spending was likely to provide a boost to business activity in the coming year.  Downward pressure on domestic energy activity intensified over the intermeeting period as oil prices dropped further.  Participants contacts in the energy sector reported that firms were still adjusting to lower prices and the contraction in their businesses, and some firms expected that they would need to cut investment and employment further.  Most notably, increases in nonfarm payroll employment were quite strong during the final three months of 2015.  Moreover, the labor force participation rate and the employment to population rate moved up toward year end.  Many viewed labor market underutilization as having been substantially reduced over the past year, and a few saw slack as having been largely eliminated.  In their comments on labor market conditions, participants cited strong employment gains, low levels of unemployment in their Districts, reports of shortages of workers in various industries, or firming in wage increases.  Most anticipated that employment would expand at a solid rate over the year ahead, although several saw the prospect of some moderation in employment gains from the particularly large increases in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Participants discussed the implications of the further decline in the prices of oil and other commodities and the additional appreciation of the dollar since the previous FOMC meeting for the outlook for inflation.  Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above trend pace of economic activity.  Several participants reiterated the importance of monitoring inflation developments closely to confirm that inflation was evolving along the path anticipated by the Committee.  Participants discussed recent developments in China, including the possibility that structural changes and financial imbalances in the Chinese economy might lead to a sharper deceleration in economic growth in that country than was generally anticipated.  Some participants also pointed to significantly tighter financing conditions for speculative grade firms and small businesses, and to reports of tighter standards at banks for C I and CRE loans.  A couple of participants pointed out that the recent decline in equity prices could be viewed as bringing equity valuations more in line with historical norms.  Participants discussed whether their current assessments of economic conditions and the medium term outlook warranted either increasing the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting or altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate.  Participants agreed that incoming indicators regarding labor market developments had been encouraging, but also that data releases since the December meeting on spending and production had been disappointing.  However, a few noted that the potential positive effects of lower energy costs on economic activity were a mitigating factor.  Most participants still expected inflation to increase gradually once energy prices and the prices of non energy imports stabilized and as the labor market strengthened further.  A couple of participants questioned whether some financial market participants fully appreciated that monetary policy is data dependent, and a number of participants emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate this aspect of monetary policy.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December suggested that labor market conditions had improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.  Members also agreed that household spending and business fixed investment had been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector had improved further; however, net exports had been soft and inventory investment had slowed.  The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipated that it would be appropriate to continue this reinvestment policy until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed.  Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.","id":63},{"text":" 3.  3.  3.","id":63},{"text":" Starts of new single family homes were somewhat lower in October than in the third quarter, although building permits moved up.

The measures from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth quarter and the Survey of Primary Dealers in December moved down slightly.  Economic activity in Canada rebounded in the third quarter, boosted by rising exports and a smaller drag from declines in oil sector investment.  However, later in the period, concerns among market participants about the implications of falling crude oil prices and the credit quality of high yield bonds evidently increased.  Quotes in financial markets and survey results suggested that investors were quite confident that the Committee would raise the federal funds target range 25 basis points at the current meeting.

Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed somewhat to the upside.  However, because of the recent further decline in crude oil prices, many participants judged that falling energy prices would depress headline inflation somewhat longer than previously anticipated.","id":64},{"text":" Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace through October because of sustained expansion in credit card balances and sizable increases in auto and student loans; growth of student loans continued to slow gradually.

The available reports from District contacts in the retail and auto industries indicated solid gains in consumer spending, and contacts were optimistic about the near term outlook.

A number of participants cited staff analysis indicating that the modest pace of labor compensation growth in recent years may have reflected slower trend productivity growth that offset the upward pressure on wages from the narrowing of labor market slack.  However, a couple of members expressed concern that this wording change could be misinterpreted as signaling too strongly the expectation that the target range for the federal funds rate would be increased at the Committee s next meeting.

After falling sharply early this year, real net exports were little changed in the second quarter and appeared to have stayed flat in the third quarter, with real exports remaining soft.  Total United States consumer prices in August, as measured by the PCE price index, were unchanged from 12 months earlier, reflecting large declines in consumer energy prices.  Chinese real GDP growth remained around 7 percent on a four quarter change basis, and information on economic activity in the euro area and the United Kingdom was consistent with continued expansion.  Even though news reports on Puerto Rico s public sector debt situation garnered attention of market participants, credit default swap spreads on Puerto Rico s general obligation debt were little changed over the intermeeting period.  The dollar depreciated early in the period following the weaker than expected United States employment report for September and the subsequent downward shift of the expected path for United States policy rates.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.

In addition, an update was provided on a data collection that will allow the calculation of the federal funds effective rate and a new overnight bank funding rate based on transaction level data reported by depository institutions that are active in overnight bank funding markets; as previously reported, the Federal Reserve expects to begin publication of the rates based on these data in the first few months of 2016.  Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was a little lower, on balance, than in the projection for the September meeting, largely reflecting a downward revision to estimated inventory investment.  They also noted uncertainty about whether economic growth was robust enough to withstand potential adverse shocks, given the limited ability of monetary policy to offset such shocks when the federal funds rate is near its effective lower bound, and concern that the beginning of policy normalization might be associated with an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions.  Several participants indicated that, in the current low interest rate environment, it would be prudent for the Committee to consider options for providing additional monetary policy accommodation if the outlook for economic activity were to weaken to a degree that seemed likely to undermine continued progress in labor market conditions and impede the movement of inflation back to the Committee s 2 percent objective over the medium term.","id":65},{"text":" The deputy manager briefed the Committee on plans for the upcoming quarterly test of the Term Deposit Facility in December and for term reverse repurchase agreement operations to be conducted ahead of year end.  The expected path for the federal funds rate implied by quotes on overnight index swap rates flattened notably over the intermeeting period.  Financing conditions for small businesses continued to improve, with loan originations maintaining their upward trend, although indicators of the optimism of small business owners declined in recent months.  The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output from 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending.  However, some participants were concerned that the recent slowdown in employment growth might prove more than temporary, and that improvement in labor market conditions might not continue.  Participants still expected that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would prove temporary.  During their discussion of economic conditions and monetary policy, participants focused on a number of issues associated with the timing and pace of policy normalization.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft.","id":65},{"text":" Moreover, consumer sentiment in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved in early October.  Total real government purchases looked to have moved sideways in the third quarter.  Energy prices and prices of non energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising next year.  Household spending and business fixed investment increased at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector improved further.  Moreover, industry contacts remained pessimistic about the outlook for the energy sector.  Such concerns might suggest that the initiation of the normalization process may not yet be warranted.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.","id":65},{"text":" There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  The Committee made no decisions regarding its strategy for ceasing or phasing out reinvestments at this meeting.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August.  With the labor force participation rate unchanged over this period, the employment to population ratio edged up.  Starts of new single family homes rose further early in the third quarter and were slightly above the pace of permit issuance.  Available indicators of drilling activity, such as counts of rigs in operation, suggested spending would decline less rapidly in the third quarter.  Federal government purchases likely decreased, as defense spending moved down further through August.  Measures of labor compensation rose faster than consumer prices over the past year, but the modest increases in compensation were similar to those seen in recent years.  Over the 12 months ending in August, average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2 1/4 percent.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities fell to near their historical lows.  Broad United States equity price indexes were highly correlated with foreign equity indexes over the intermeeting period and posted net declines.  Corporate bond and institutional leveraged loan issuance remained solid through July but moderated in August.  Although net exports remained soft, household spending and business fixed investment were increasing moderately, and the housing sector recovered further.  Participants noted that ongoing gains in employment and real income were providing support for the rise in spending, and this support was expected to continue going forward.  The available reports from District contacts in the retail and auto industries confirmed the recent solid gains in consumer spending.  Recent readings on headline consumer price inflation reflected only small increases in core inflation and renewed weakness in consumer energy prices.  Such considerations also argued for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate gradually after policy normalization was under way.  Some other participants, however, expressed concerns about delaying the start of normalizing the target range for the federal funds rate much longer.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","id":66},{"text":" System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy A staff briefing provided background on the macroeconomic effects of alternative approaches to ceasing reinvestments of principal on securities held in the SOMA after the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy by increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.  However, if substantial adverse shocks occurred, continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way could help avoid situations that would warrant a larger reduction in the federal funds rate than perhaps could be accomplished given the constraint posed by the effective lower bound to nominal interest rates.  Despite the decline in global equity markets and the downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury securities moved up modestly, with some market participants citing purported sales of Treasury securities by foreign government authorities to finance foreign exchange market intervention as a factor that likely put upward pressure on Treasury yields.  Contacts in a number of Districts were upbeat about prospects for the sector, citing strengthening sales, rising home prices, an upturn in household formations, and reports that buyers had accelerated purchases in anticipation of the possibility that mortgage rates might move higher in the near term.","id":66},{"text":" Participants referred to the Committee s statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which indicates that the timing of the cessation or phasing out of reinvestments will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.  Automakers scheduled further declines in assemblies over the remainder of the year, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, including readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally suggested that factory output would be little changed over that period.  Based on federal funds futures, the probability of a first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September meeting fell slightly; the probabilities attached to subsequent meetings through January 2016 were generally little changed and rose for meetings later that year.  Changes in peripheral euro area sovereign yield spreads were mixed, with Greek sovereign spreads narrowing significantly over the period as Greece and the euro area finalized Greece s third bailout package.  With energy prices and non oil import prices expected to begin to increase steadily next year, the staff projected that inflation would rise gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018.  Contacts were generally optimistic about the outlook, although retail sales appeared to be softening in a few areas where economic activity was adversely affected by declines in the energy sector and the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Underutilization of labor resources had diminished along a number of dimensions The unemployment rate had fallen to a level close to most participants estimates of its longer run normal rate, and the numbers of discouraged workers and those employed part time for economic reasons had moved lower.","id":66},{"text":" These participants preferred to begin policy firming soon, with most of them expecting that beginning the process before long would allow the target range for the federal funds rate to be increased gradually.

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.","id":66},{"text":" The deputy manager followed with a briefing on money market developments and System open market operations conducted by the Open Market Desk during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on July 28 29.  However, market based measures of inflation compensation fell to near their historical lows, reportedly in response to the recent appreciation of the dollar, the decline in oil prices, and readings on realized inflation that were slightly below market expectations.  The longer run projections represent each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  But some others believed that labor market slack in addition to that measured by the unemployment rate remained and that further progress was possible before labor market conditions were fully consistent with the Committee s objective of maximum employment.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.  One member, however, preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, indicating that the current low level of real interest rates was not appropriate in the context of current economic conditions.  The Committee also maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":66},{"text":" Daily take up in the Desk s overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations declined somewhat, apart from month ends, likely reflecting some increase in money market interest rates.  Household spending was supported by moderate growth in real disposable income in July and a wealth to income ratio that remained high even after recent declines in equity values.  Real spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining increased sharply in the second quarter, and nominal business expenditures for such structures rose further in July.  Although concerns about global economic growth likely contributed to the declines in domestic equity prices, investors may also have reassessed valuations and risk in equity markets.  On net, the level of GDP was anticipated to rise above its potential next year, and that gap was projected to widen gradually over the medium term.  Surveys continued to show stable longer run inflation expectations, and most participants continued to anticipate that longer run inflation expectations would remain well anchored.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.","id":66},{"text":" The staff also proposed that future changes in the FOMC s target federal funds rate range as well as associated changes in related administered interest rates including the interest rates on excess and required reserves, the ON RRP rate, and the primary credit rate all be effective on the day after the Committee s policy decision.  These strategies included either characterizing qualitatively or specifying numerically the economic conditions under which reinvestments would cease, or establishing a date or time interval following the initial firming of the federal funds rate for the new policy on reinvestments to begin.  Automakers assembly schedules pointed to a solid gain in light motor vehicle production in the third quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, including readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally suggested only modest increases in factory output in the coming months.  The strong capital position of the United States banking sector, low to moderate use of leverage elsewhere in the financial system, stability in the level of maturity transformation by financial institutions, and still moderate rates of borrowing by the private nonfinancial sector were seen as factors supporting overall financial stability.  Participants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their earlier assessment that the weak report on real GDP in the first quarter reflected transitory factors and expected that real economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace over the balance of the year, leading to further improvement in labor market conditions.  Overall, most contacts viewed the recent slowdown in manufacturing as likely to prove temporary and remained optimistic about future demand, even though the recent decreases in oil prices and the possibility of adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in China raised some concerns.  In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, participants generally viewed the risks from the fiscal and financial problems in Greece as having diminished somewhat, although it was observed that Greece still faced many challenges and that Greek economic progress was likely to be limited over the near term.  However, several participants contended that, despite the progress over the past few years, some noticeable margins of slack remained, citing as evidence the high number of workers not actively searching for jobs but available and interested in work as well as the high share of employees working part time for economic reasons compared with pre recession levels.  They commented on issues related to the deterioration in bond market liquidity reported by market participants, the potential migration of leveraged loan underwriting to the nonbank sector in light of current supervisory guidance, and the assessment of valuation risks when term premiums were narrow while most other risk premiums were not.  The Committee also modified the discussion of inflation developments slightly to recognize the more recent declines in energy prices while restating the expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.","id":67},{"text":" In their discussion, most participants expressed a preference that the timing of the cessation of reinvestments be based on a qualitative assessment of economic conditions and the outlook.  Starts of new single family houses declined in June but rose for the quarter as a whole, and the level of permit issuance pointed to increases in starts in subsequent months.  However, real state and local government purchases appeared to have risen last quarter, as nominal construction spending rebounded following a decline in the first quarter and payrolls for these governments were little changed.  Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases, including the June employment report and retail sales data, put some downward pressure on the path of expected future short term interest rates.  The expected path of the federal funds rate moved down following the June FOMC statement and the Chair s postmeeting press conference.  Market participants reportedly saw as notable the downward revisions in the June SEP to FOMC participants projections of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015.  Corporate bond issuance remained strong in the second quarter; issuance of institutional leveraged loans picked up noticeably, likely due in part to tighter loan spreads as compared with the beginning of the year.  CRE loans on banks books expanded in the second quarter, consistent with stronger loan demand reported in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).  However, rising debt burdens for riskier businesses as well as somewhat elevated valuations and loosening lending standards for many asset classes pointed to some increasing concerns.  Although energy prices and non oil import prices were expected to begin rising steadily next year, the staff continued to project that inflation would be below the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent over 2016 and 2017.  Participants viewed the recent data on housing starts and permits as well as the higher levels of sales and prices as indicative of continued recovery in the housing sector.  Some participants advised that progress toward the Committee s objectives should be viewed in light of the cumulative gains made to date without overemphasizing month to month changes in incoming data.  Most members saw room for some additional progress in reducing labor market slack, although several viewed current labor market conditions as at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment.  The Committee concluded that, although it had seen further progress, the economic conditions warranting an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate had not yet been met.","id":67},{"text":" While these developments attracted investor attention, reaction in asset markets outside Greece and China was limited on balance.  Participants discussed how recent developments influenced their expectations for reaching the FOMC s 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.  Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.  Many members thought that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic activity evolved as they expected.  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.","id":67},{"text":" It would also help promote federal funds trading within the new target range, partly by enabling the Desk to conduct ON RRP operations at the new rate specified by the Committee on the same day that the new target range becomes effective.  Although the labor force participation rate declined in June and the national hiring and quits rates were little changed in May, several participants noted that reports from business contacts in their Districts pointed to continued job gains and relatively strong labor markets.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.","id":67},{"text":" Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand at a solid pace in June.  Activity in the housing sector improved somewhat in recent months but remained slow.  However, the rig count appeared to be bottoming out in recent weeks.  On balance, broad United States equity price indexes were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Credit conditions in municipal bond markets were stable over the intermeeting period.  Equity prices in emerging market economies, however, generally moved lower on net.  Participants generally expected consumer spending to rise moderately over the near term.  The service sector reports were mostly positive.","id":67},{"text":" By contrast, yields in Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden decreased following weaker than expected macroeconomic data releases and additional monetary policy accommodation.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated.  However, businesses particularly exposed to the appreciation of the dollar or falling commodity prices including those in the heavy equipment and steel, oil and gas extraction, and petrochemical industries reported slower activity.","id":67},{"text":"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was expected to step up from its pace in the first half.  In discussing how to interpret the reported weakness in real GDP during the first quarter, participants considered alternative estimates of real economic activity based on various data filtering models maintained by Board and Reserve Bank staff.  The additional information that had become available since then, including more complete estimates of outlays for services and revised data on retail sales, indicated that consumer spending was somewhat better than previously reported, rising at a moderate pace in the first quarter.  However, others remained concerned that consumers had not increased their spending as much as expected in response to the drop in energy prices, and that the rise in the saving rate since last fall may signal more cautious behavior among households that might last for some time.  Still, cutbacks in spending on drilling and mining equipment, slow demand for other business equipment, and the drag on exports from slow foreign demand and previous increases in the dollar continued to weigh on industrial production.  Higher oil production could continue to hold down energy prices in the near term, but industry contacts anticipated some recovery in prices over the coming year, which should stem layoffs and cuts in capital spending in the energy sector.  A number of participants noted that the outlook for continued job gains was evident in reports on hiring intentions from business contacts in their Districts who indicated that more firms planned additions to their payrolls over the coming year than a year earlier.  While the cumulative improvements in labor market conditions over the past year had been substantial, most participants judged that further progress would be required to eliminate underutilization of labor resources; some of them anticipated that the utilization gap would close around the end of the year.  One such risk was the possibility that the Committee might need to tighten more rapidly than financial markets currently anticipate an outcome that could be associated with a significant rise in longer term interest rates or heightened financial market volatility.  All participants supported a staff proposal for the Federal Reserve to issue an implementation note that would communicate separately from the Committee s postmeeting policy statement the specific measures to be employed to implement the FOMC s decision about the stance of policy.  Committee Policy Action In its discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the Committee agreed that the weakness in the first quarter was at least in part the result of transitory factors, and members anticipated that economic growth would resume in the second quarter.  With respect to its objective of maximum employment, the Committee judged that, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources had diminished somewhat over the intermeeting period.  In considering how to communicate the rationale for the Committee s policy decision, members discussed the importance of adjusting the language in the postmeeting statement to acknowledge the evolution of progress toward the Committee s objectives.  The Committee judged it appropriate to communicate that it had seen some further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period, stating that a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":68},{"text":" Some participants indicated that the higher alternative estimates seemed more consistent with the increases in real gross domestic income and private domestic final purchases in the first quarter as well as the strength in employment and hours worked.  Other concerns were related to whether the apparent weakness in productivity growth recently would be reversed or continue.  On the one hand, a rebound in productivity growth in coming quarters might restrain hiring and slow the improvement in labor market conditions.  Many participants anticipated that these factors would support a solid pace of consumer spending going forward.  Agricultural production in several Districts appeared likely to benefit from wet weather, but weak farm income continued to weigh on the sector.  Several other participants indicated that, in their view, labor market slack had already been largely eliminated.  Recent readings on the employment cost index, hourly compensation, and average hourly earnings of employees suggested some acceleration in wages.  The sharp rise in German yields appeared to reflect a retracing of the earlier decline in German rates to unsustainably low levels.  Most participants judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved; a number of them cautioned against a premature decision.  Some participants viewed the economic conditions for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate as having been met or were confident that they would be met shortly.  Participants also discussed plans for publishing operational details regarding the implementation of monetary policy around the time of the first increase in the target range.  Participants also discussed how the language of the domestic policy directive could be revised when the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate becomes appropriate.  Labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, and members anticipated further progress in coming months.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.","id":68},{"text":" The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was also little changed.  The United States international trade deficit narrowed sharply in February, as imports fell more than exports.  Market based measures of inflation compensation at longer horizons increased somewhat but were still low.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial conditions eased, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Federal Reserve communications that were reportedly viewed as more accommodative than anticipated put downward pressure on interest rates.  On net, measures of inflation compensation rose, equity prices increased somewhat, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined.  Energy firms stock prices retraced a small portion of their substantial drop since mid 2014.  Nonetheless, first quarter earnings per share were expected to be lower than in the previous quarter.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative.  House prices continued to rise moderately in February.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets stayed generally accommodative.  Nonetheless, the cumulative appreciation of the dollar since mid 2014 remained substantial.  Spillovers from Greek markets into other peripheral financial markets remained limited.  Participants also pointed to other reasons for anticipating that the weakness seen in the first quarter would not endure.  Many participants judged that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions had slowed.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.","id":69},{"text":" Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half of the year was lower than in the projection prepared for the March meeting, as the data on economic activity received during the intermeeting period were generally weaker than the staff had expected.  In keeping with this data dependent approach, some participants further suggested that the postmeeting statement s description of the economic situation and outlook, and of progress toward the Committee s goals, provided the appropriate means by which the Committee could help the public assess the likely timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The Committee also agreed to change the statement s characterization of the labor market data to note that the pace of job growth slowed over the intermeeting period and that a number of labor market indicators suggested that there was little change in underutilization of labor resources, and to update the statement s description of investment and export behavior in light of the recent weaker readings.  The Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to reaffirm in the statement that the Committee s decision about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","id":69},{"text":" The United States dollar depreciated during the intermeeting period, as United States macroeconomic data generally came in weaker than expected, and as market participants appeared to mark down somewhat their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate.  An estimate of the expected real return on equities moved down, reflecting an increase in stock prices and downward revisions to forecasts of corporate earnings, and corporate bond spreads declined somewhat.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth had slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee s 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of declines in energy prices and non energy import prices dissipated.  Finally, if the decline in oil prices and the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar did not continue, then their influence on the growth rate of investment and the change in net exports would likely recede.  A number of participants suggested that the damping effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar on net exports or of the earlier decline in oil prices on firms investment spending might be larger and longer lasting than previously anticipated.  Another participant argued that low values for market based measures of inflation compensation should concern policymakers, on the grounds that these low values reflected investors placing at least some likelihood on adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity.  Some participants noted the possibility that, at the time when the Committee decides to begin policy firming, term premiums could rise sharply in a manner similar to the increase observed in the spring and summer of 2013 which might drive longer term interest rates higher.  In their discussion of communications regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the medium term, participants expressed a range of views about when economic conditions were likely to warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when they had seen further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Although participants expressed different views about the likely timing and pace of policy firming, they agreed that the Committee s decision to begin firming would appropriately depend on the incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.  A few anticipated that the information that would accrue by the time of the June meeting would likely indicate sufficient improvement in the economic outlook to lead the Committee to judge that its conditions for beginning policy firming had been met.  However, most participants felt that the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would appropriately be determined on a meeting by meeting basis and would depend on the evolution of economic conditions and the outlook.  In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, members agreed that the wording should reflect their assessment that economic conditions had progressed to a stage at which the Committee s decision to begin normalizing policy would appropriately be determined on a meeting by meeting basis.  The Committee also decided to maintain its policy of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.","id":69},{"text":" However, much of this weakness was attributed to transitory factors or statistical noise, with little implication for the pace of expansion beyond the near term.  Most participants expected that, following the slowdown in the first quarter, real economic activity would resume expansion at a moderate pace, and that labor market conditions would improve further.  Participants generally agreed that data on private spending for the first quarter had been disappointing, with unexpectedly weak household expenditures and investment spending.  Participants discussed whether the weakness of spending in the first quarter primarily reflected temporary factors or instead suggested a longer lasting loss of momentum for the economy.  A number of the fundamental factors that drive consumer spending remained favorable, among them low interest rates, high consumer confidence, and rising household real income.  In addition, business contacts in several parts of the country continued to be optimistic and expected sales, investment, and hiring to expand over the rest of the year.  In their discussion of the foreign economic outlook, several participants noted that the foreign exchange value of the United States dollar had fallen back somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Some participants noted that careful Committee communications regarding its policy intentions could help damp any resulting increase in market volatility around the time of the commencement of normalization.  Inflation continued to run below the Committee s longer run objective, but this partly reflected earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non energy imports.

Recent information about key factors that influence household spending pointed toward a pickup in PCE in the coming months.  The pace of activity in the housing sector remained slow.  Both starts and building permits for new single family homes declined over January and February.  Federal spending data for January and February pointed toward a further decline in real federal government purchases in the first quarter.  For borrowers who qualify for a mortgage, the cost of credit stayed low by historical standards.  Several participants judged that the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant beginning normalization at the June meeting.  Household spending was rising moderately, with declines in energy prices boosting household purchasing power.

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period, including the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, reportedly were perceived as slightly more accommodative than expected on balance.  The staff s medium term forecast for real GDP growth also was revised down, mostly because of the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that the pace of economic activity had moderated somewhat.  They continued to expect that inflation would move up toward the Committee s 2 percent objective over the medium term as the effects of these transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market improved further.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.","id":70},{"text":" Market commentary also highlighted Chair Yellen s statement at the Monetary Policy Report testimony that the eventual removal of the language in the policy statement noting that the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy should not be viewed as indicating that the federal funds rate would necessarily be increased within a couple of meetings.  Nonetheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP would expand at a faster pace than potential output in 2015 and 2016, supported by increases in consumer and business confidence and a small pickup in foreign economic growth, even as the normalization of monetary policy was assumed to begin.  It was noted that eliminating the reference to being patient would be appropriate in light of the considerable progress achieved toward the Committee s objective of maximum employment, and that such a change would not indicate that the Committee had decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  However, others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar s appreciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year, and a couple of participants suggested that the economic outlook likely would not call for liftoff until 2016.  With regard to communications about the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, two participants thought that the Committee should seek to signal its policy intentions at the meeting before liftoff appeared likely, but two others judged that doing so would be inconsistent with a meeting by meeting approach.

After taking into account deals in the pipeline for March, issuance in the first quarter of 2015 was expected to be the strongest since the financial crisis.

By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Program for Security of FOMC Information with changes to how Federal Reserve Banks classify and access Committee information.  In its annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants generally agreed that only a minor update was required at this meeting.  Several participants observed that this statement had helped to increase public understanding of the Committee s goals and policy framework.  Mister Tarullo abstained because he did not believe the statement reflects sufficient consensus in the principles underlying the Committee s policy actions so as to significantly advance public understanding of its monetary policy strategy.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet In a joint session of the Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets.  The deputy manager followed with a review of System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on December 16 17, 2014.  The deputy manager also discussed the outcomes of recent tests of term and overnight reverse repurchase agreements (term RRPs and ON RRPs, respectively).  These tests suggested that the combination of term RRP and ON RRP operations had been effective in supporting money market rates leading into and over year end.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account over the intermeeting period.  Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options A staff briefing provided some background on possible options for the use of supplementary tools, in addition to interest on excess reserves (IOER), that the Committee could choose to use during the early stages of policy normalization.  The purpose of these options was to help ensure sufficient control over the federal funds rate and other short term interest rates during this period while mitigating potential risks associated with particular policy tools.  The presentation discussed the possibility of establishing, on a temporary basis, an aggregate cap for ON RRP operations that was substantially above the cap the Committee had chosen for the purposes of testing such operations.  In their discussion of these issues, participants generally agreed that it was very important for the commencement of policy firming to proceed successfully.  Consequently, most were prepared to take the steps necessary to ensure that the federal funds rate traded within the target range established by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Some participants noted that a relatively high cap could be established and then reduced fairly soon after the initial policy firming if it was determined that it was not needed, and that such a reduction could help underscore the Committee s intent to use such a facility only to the extent necessary.  A number of participants emphasized that the Committee should develop plans to ensure that such a facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  With regard to the possible use of term RRP operations as an additional supplementary tool, participants noted that recent testing showed that term RRP operations ahead of the year end were associated with a significant decline in the level of take up at ON RRP operations.  With regard to the potential use of other tools, several participants noted that the IOER and ON RRP rates should be set at the top and bottom, respectively, of the target range for the federal funds rate.  At the conclusion of their discussion, participants generally agreed that it would be useful to discuss further at coming meetings specific calibrations of policy tools that could be used during the early stages of policy normalization.  In the second proposal, the Desk would conduct small term RRP operations in February and early March, in addition to the quarter end option presented in the first proposal.  In their discussion of term RRP testing, participants noted that the testing could provide further information about the substitutability between the ON and term RRP operations, including outside year end and quarter end periods.  The System Open Market Account manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations.  These operations shall be conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit of $300 billion per day.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 27 28 meeting indicated that economic activity expanded at a solid pace over the second half of 2014, and that labor market conditions had again improved in recent months.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded in December and the gains for October and November were revised up, putting the increase for the fourth quarter above that for the third quarter.  Automakers assembly schedules for the first quarter and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, generally pointed to moderate gains in factory output early this year.  In contrast, some indicators of mining activity, such as counts of drilling rigs in operation, weakened, presumably reflecting the recent sharp declines in energy prices.  Data on spending in the third quarter were revised up, and the components of nominal retail sales used to construct estimates of PCE rose briskly in the fourth quarter.  Real disposable personal income increased in November; since then, continued declines in energy prices likely raised the purchasing power of households incomes.  Households net worth likely increased as home values and equity prices advanced, and consumer sentiment, as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, moved up in early January to its highest level in more than a decade.  Starts of new single family homes increased in December to their highest level since 2008, and permits for new construction also moved higher.  Sales of new homes increased, on net, in November and December, while sales of existing homes declined, on average, over those two months.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures edged down in November but remained higher than in the third quarter.  On balance, the Treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period, while interest rate volatility increased somewhat.  Credit flows to nonfinancial firms generally remained strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they slowed somewhat for riskier firms.  Gross corporate bond issuance continued to be solid, although speculative grade bond issuance declined late in the year and remained subdued into January.  Issuance of collateralized loan obligations declined but remained elevated; 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance of such securities.  The price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers declined again over the intermeeting period, with interest rates on 30 year fixed rate mortgages reaching levels close to their all time lows.  Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely accommodative over the intermeeting period.  The effects on the largest banking firms of the sharp decline in oil prices and developments in foreign exchange markets appeared limited, although other institutions with more concentrated exposures could face strains if oil prices remain at current levels for a prolonged period.  In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain slightly above, the rate of growth of potential output.  In addition, the incoming data on consumer prices apart from those for energy showed a somewhat smaller rise than anticipated.  Nevertheless, inflation was projected to reach 2 percent over time, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee s objective and slack in labor and product markets anticipated to fade.  Although growth likely slowed from the rapid rate recorded for the third quarter of 2014, a variety of indicators suggested that real GDP continued to grow faster than potential GDP late in the year and during January.  Participants expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a moderate pace sufficient to lead to further improvements in labor market conditions toward levels consistent with the Committee s objective of maximum employment.  Inflation had declined further below the Committee s longer run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was anticipated to decline further in the near term.  Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee s 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated.  Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment.  However, it was noted that the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and that tepid nominal wage growth, if continued, could become a significant restraining factor for household spending.  Although manufacturing activity appeared to have slowed somewhat over the intermeeting period in some regions, business contacts suggested that this slowing was likely to prove temporary, and information from some parts of the country suggested that capital investment was poised to pick up.  In addition, it was observed that if capital investment in energy producing industries slowed significantly, it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period, especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred.  Accommodative policy actions announced by a number of foreign central banks had likely strengthened the outlook abroad.  The decline in energy prices was also seen as potentially exerting a stronger than anticipated positive effect on growth in the domestic economy and abroad.  Several participants remarked that inflation measures that excluded energy items had also moved down in recent months, but these declines partly reflected transitory factors, including downward pressure on import prices and the pass through of lower energy costs to the prices of non energy items.  If this was the case, nominal wage growth could be expected to pick up in coming periods and to resume a more normal relationship with labor market slack.  Participants discussed the sizable decline in market based measures of inflation compensation that had been observed over the past year and continued over the intermeeting period.  Others observed that insofar as the shifts reflected concerns about growth prospects abroad or were accompanied by a stronger dollar, the implications for United States monetary policy were less clear.  Participants Discussion of Policy Planning Participants discussed considerations related to the choice of the appropriate timing of the initial firming in monetary policy and pace of subsequent rate increases.  It was also suggested that maintaining the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for an extended period or raising it rapidly, if that proved necessary, could adversely affect financial stability.  Some participants were concerned that a decision to delay the commencement of tightening could be perceived as indicating that an overly accommodative policy is likely to prevail during the firming phase.  In addition, an earlier tightening would increase the likelihood that the Committee might be forced by adverse economic outcomes to return the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound.  Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the beginning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time.  Participants discussed the economic conditions that they anticipate will prevail at the time they expect it will be appropriate to begin normalizing policy.  Nonetheless, a number of participants suggested that they would need to see further improvement in labor market conditions and data pointing to continued growth in real activity at a pace sufficient to support additional labor market gains before beginning policy normalization.  Participants discussed the communications challenges associated with signaling, when it becomes appropriate to do so, that policy normalization is likely to begin relatively soon while remaining clear that the Committee s actions would depend on incoming data.  Many participants regarded dropping the patient language in the statement, whenever that might occur, as risking a shift in market expectations for the beginning of policy firming toward an unduly narrow range of dates.  Participants discussed some possible communications by which they might further underscore the data dependency of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy.  A number of participants noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could provide about its timing.  Looking ahead, some participants highlighted the potential benefits of streamlining the Committee s postmeeting statement once normalization has begun.  Household spending was rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.  Inflation had declined further below the Committee s longer run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices, and was expected to decline further in the near term.  The Committee also expected that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  In their discussion of language for the postmeeting statement, members generally agreed that they should acknowledge the solid growth over the second half of 2014 as well as the further improvement in labor market conditions over the intermeeting period.  Members also agreed that it was appropriate to observe that lower energy prices had boosted household purchasing power.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Household spending is rising moderately; recent declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.  This policy, by keeping the Committee s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.","id":71},{"text":" 3.  3.  3.","id":71},{"text":" In the euro area, far forward measures of inflation compensation fell noticeably, and market participants reportedly increasingly came to believe that further monetary policy accommodation would be needed.  Industrial production moved down in April and picked up in May, leaving output about flat over those two months, but production was lower than at the beginning of the year.  Issuance of agency and non agency CMBS was solid in May, and CRE lending by banks expanded in April and May at a slower rate than in the first quarter.  They still anticipated that the overall rate of inflation would firm somewhat and move up to the Committee s longer run symmetric objective of 2 percent over the next few years.

Market participants attributed recent increases in repo rates on month end and mid month Treasury auction settlement dates in part to elevated net dealer inventories of Treasury securities, which dealers finance in the repo market.  The labor force participation rate moved down somewhat in April and held steady in May, remaining close to its average over the previous few years; the employment to population ratio stayed flat in April and May.  While measures from the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed, the preliminary June reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dropped significantly to below its range in recent years.  Automakers assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would move up in the near term, but new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to continued soft total factory output in the coming months.  Federal government purchases were being boosted by strong increases in defense spending through May and the return of nondefense purchases to more typical levels after the partial federal government shutdown in the first quarter.  Based on overnight index swap rates, investors expected the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points by the end of this year a downward revision of 40 basis points over the intermeeting period.  The average of the effective federal funds rate over the period was about 6 basis points below the level just before the May FOMC meeting, well within the FOMC s target range.  The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was little changed, as the effects of a higher projected path for the broad real dollar and lower trajectory for foreign economic growth were largely counterbalanced by a lower projected path for interest rates.  With labor market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.  Many participants noted that, since the Committee s previous meeting, the economy appeared to have lost some momentum and pointed to a number of factors supporting that view including recent weak indicators for business confidence, business spending and manufacturing activity; trade developments; and signs of slowing global economic growth.  In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, participants noted that, under their baseline outlook, the labor market was likely to remain strong with economic activity growing at a moderate pace.  Several participants noted that a near term cut in the target range for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects of possible future adverse shocks to the economy and, hence, was appropriate policy from a risk management perspective.  Several participants pointed out that they had revised down their estimates of the longer run normal rate of unemployment and, as a result, saw a smaller upward contribution to inflation pressures from tight resource utilization than they had earlier.  Some participants suggested that although they now judged that the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would follow a flatter trajectory than they had previously assumed, there was not yet a strong case for a rate cut from current levels.","id":36},{"text":" Treasury yields fell sharply and far forward measures of inflation compensation dropped significantly in the United States and abroad.

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on average, in April and May; however, job gains slowed sharply in May after a strong increase in April.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.0 percent.  Net exports added substantially to real GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports increased robustly and imports fell.  Partly reflecting that combination of developments, several participants had revised down their SEP estimates of the longer run normal rate of unemployment.","id":36},{"text":" Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in April.  Recent indicators suggested that the pace of economic activity picked up in Canada in the second quarter but slowed in some other AFEs.  Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.  The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and remain below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate.","id":36},{"text":" Nearly all respondents on the Open Market Desk s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants anticipated that the federal funds target range would be unchanged for the remainder of the year.  In addition, some market participants pointed to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in connection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate.  The proposed action would bring these rates to 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate and 10 basis points above the bottom of the range and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offer rate.  The staff judged that the narrower spread did not pose a significant risk of increased take up at the ON RRP facility because repo rates had been trading well above the ON RRP offer rate for some time.  However, if it became appropriate in the future to further lower the IOER rate, the staff noted that the Committee might wish to first consider where to set the ON RRP offer rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate to mitigate this risk.  The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  Automakers assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would move up in the near term, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to modest gains in overall factory output in the coming months.  Real purchases by state and local governments increased briskly; payrolls of those governments expanded solidly in the first quarter, and nominal state and local construction spending rose markedly.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed.  Market participants cited more accommodative than expected monetary policy communications coupled with strong United States and Chinese data releases and positive sentiment about trade negotiations between the United States and China as factors that contributed to these developments.  Investors cited larger than expected downward revisions in FOMC participants assessments of the future path of the policy rate in the Summary of Economic Projections, recent communications suggesting a patient approach to monetary policy, and weaker than expected euro area data releases early in the period among factors that contributed to this decrease.  The build up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more broadly.  With labor market conditions still judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.  Participants cited continuing strength in labor market conditions, improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions, or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad, as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year.  In discussing developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial market conditions had improved following the period of stress observed over the fourth quarter of last year and that the volatility in prices and financial conditions had subsided.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate.  With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove references to a slowing in the pace of economic growth and little changed payroll employment, consistent with stronger incoming information on these indicators.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2 00 p.m.  The Committee directs the Desk to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion.","id":37},{"text":" Elevated repo rates contributed to upward pressure on the federal funds rate, as FHLBs reportedly shifted some of their liquidity investments out of federal funds and into the repo market.  The deputy manager also discussed a staff proposal in which the Board would implement a 5 basis point technical adjustment to the Interest on Required Reserves (IORR) and IOER rates.  Building permit issuance for new single family homes which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes declined a little in February and March.  Major United States equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, with the S P 500 equity index returning to the levels it reached before its decline in the last quarter of 2018.  The staff s lower path for interest rates reflected a methodological change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast.  Participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation, and inflation for items other than food and energy, had come in lower than expected.  Some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had accounted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years.  After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 percent.","id":37},{"text":" Several factors appeared to spur this upward pressure.  The votes to renew the Federal Reserve s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting.

Real residential investment declined at a slower rate in the first quarter than it did over the course of 2018.  Forward looking indicators of business equipment spending pointed to sluggish increases in the near term.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities were changed little, on net, and remained below their early fall 2018 levels.  The EFFR rose to 5 basis points above the IOER rate after the federal income tax deadline on April 15.

Broad equity price indexes rose notably and corporate bond spreads narrowed amid a decline in market volatility, and financing conditions for businesses and households also eased.

A few participants suggested that heightened leverage and associated debt burdens could render the business sector more sensitive to economic downturns than would otherwise be the case.","id":37},{"text":" Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased somewhat in the first quarter after having declined for several quarters.  However, the average dollar value of exports in the first two months of the year was only slightly above its fourth quarter value.  Market participants assigned greater probability to a lower target range of the federal funds rate than to a higher one beyond the next few meetings.  Consumer credit conditions remained broadly supportive of growth in household spending, with all categories of consumer loans recording steady growth in the first quarter.  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.  Participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, with strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  Taken together, these developments suggested that the first quarter softness in household spending was likely to prove temporary.  More generally, the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment.  In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 percent.  Participants judged that the labor market remained strong, and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate.","id":37},{"text":" In China, authorities moved toward an easier fiscal and monetary stance; China s aggregate credit growth had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the declining trend observed last year.  The Shanghai Composite index had risen notably since the turn of the year, driven in part by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures as well as perceived progress on trade negotiations.  The assessment of the minimum operating level of reserves would be based on a range of information, including surveys of banks and market participants, data on banks reserve holdings, and market monitoring.  The average level of reserves over the medium term would then be above the minimum operating level, providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in nonreserve liabilities.  Nevertheless, participants generally expected the growth rate of real GDP this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longer run growth.  Participants also observed that much of the recent softness likely reflected temporary factors, such as the partial federal government shutdown and December s volatility in financial markets, and that consumer sentiment had recovered after these factors had receded.  Some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors reported that business conditions were favorable, with strong demand for labor, business sentiment had recovered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates would provide some support for construction activity.","id":38},{"text":" Consistent with ongoing investor uncertainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound dollar currency pair continued to point to higher demand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar.  In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, stepped up in February and early March to an upbeat level.  Most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the Committee s longer run objective of 2 percent over the next few years.  A few participants observed that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development helping to bolster potential output and damp inflationary pressures.  A couple of participants noted that, over the medium term, some easing in payroll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longer run trend rate.  Several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments.  The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.","id":38},{"text":" The staff forecast that United States real GDP growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer spending and business investment.

Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the March 19 20 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, al though growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid fourth quarter pace.  Real residential investment appeared to be softening further in the first quarter, likely reflecting, in part, decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing house price appreciation.  Consequently, many participants expected consumer spending to proceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by favorable underlying factors, including a strong labor market, solid growth in household incomes, improvements in financial conditions and in households balance sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment.  Many participants indicated that, while inflation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong labor market conditions and rising nominal wage growth, as well as to the short term upward pressure on prices arising from tariff increases.  In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near record levels of job openings and help wanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months.  Participants judged that the labor market remained strong, but that information received over the intermeeting period, including recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment, pointed to slower economic growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Committee directs the Selected Bank to maintain, for the System Open Market Account 4.  The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Committee regarding the management of the foreign currency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authorization.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  The deterioration in risk sentiment late in December was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin trading conditions around year end.  On balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while corporate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the September FOMC meeting.  The deputy manager reported results from the Open Market Desk s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants.  Moreover, no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the behavior of the federal funds rate; the correlation between daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds rate remained close to zero.  In addition, the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a series of backward looking average secured overnight financing rates (SOFR) as a further step to support reference rate reform.  The staff planned to solicit public feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publication of these averages by the first half of 2020.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Long Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks Committee participants resumed their discussion from the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long run framework for monetary policy implementation.  At the January meeting, the staff provided briefings on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Committee s current operating regime and on options for transitioning to the longer run size of the balance sheet.  Over this period, the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at levels well within the Committee s target range despite substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking system and significant changes in money markets, regulations, and financial institutions business models.  In addition, other money market rates generally moved closely with the federal funds rate.  The current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets.  The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate.  The staff also described options for communicating plans both for the operating regime and for the completion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet.  In addition, the Committee could revise its previous communications to make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normalizing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to support the FOMC s broader policy goals.  Participants noted some of the key advantages of the Federal Reserve s current operating regime, including good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets.  They observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active management of the supply of reserves likely would have disadvantages.  In particular, the level and variability of reserve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations.  Participants judged that, in light of their extensive previous discussions, it was now appropriate to provide the public with more certainty that the Federal Reserve would continue to use its current operating regime.  Choosing an operating regime would also allow the Committee to move forward on related issues, including plans for concluding the normalization of the size of the balance sheet.  Participants discussed market commentary that suggested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets.  Participants noted that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve s asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more than a year, with no significant effects on financial markets.  The gradual reduction in securities holdings had been announced well in advance and, as intended, was proceeding largely in the background, with the federal funds rate remaining the Committee s primary tool for adjusting the stance of policy.  Nonetheless, some investors might have interpreted previous communications as indicating that a very high threshold would have to be met before the Committee would be willing to adjust its balance sheet normalization plans.  In these participants view, this process would allow the Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short term interest rates without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations.  These participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable.  Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons continued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007.  Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with warmer than usual temperatures lowering the demand for heating.  Automakers assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would ease somewhat in the first quarter, although new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in overall factory output in the coming months.  Household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in October and November.  The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indicators such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December.  Key factors that influence consumer spending including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and still elevated measures of households net worth continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was less upbeat in early January than it had been last year but remained at a generally favorable level.  Forward looking indicators of business equipment spending such as orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on business sentiment pointed to somewhat slower spending gains in the near term.  Data on nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in November were not available.  The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector was roughly flat in December and through most of January.  Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed.  The partial federal government shutdown restrained real federal purchases somewhat in the fourth quarter and likely had a more significant negative effect on federal purchases in the first quarter.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor risk sentiment fluctuated materially over the intermeeting period.  During this time, broad equity indexes declined substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market volatility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably.  Despite the intermeeting moves in financial markets, financial conditions remained notably tighter than in September 2018. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit further over the intermeeting period but remained generally supportive of spending.  December FOMC communications were reportedly perceived by market participants as not fully appreciating the implications of tighter financial conditions and softening global data over recent months for the United States economic outlook.  The market implied path for the federal funds rate in 2019 was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and investors continued to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at the January FOMC meeting.  Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated substantially, with heightened risk aversion contributing to a significant decline in yields early in the intermeeting period.  The spread between the yields on nominal 10 and 2 year Treasury securities was little changed over the period, and remained in the lower end of its historical range over recent decades.  The federal funds rate and other overnight funding rates rose following the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting.  Year end pressures in repo markets were reportedly exacerbated by a high volume of settlements of Treasury securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories and reduced intermediation by global systemically important banks.  The dollar depreciated notably against the British pound, on net, as market participants reportedly saw an increased likelihood of a delay in the Brexit process.  The dollar also depreciated considerably against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso following progress on pension reform in Brazil and a fiscal announcement in Mexico that was perceived as prudent.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed considerably in December across the credit rating spectrum but rebounded in January.  Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at levels well above those that prevailed a year ago.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest level since July 2016, as loan spreads widened substantially.  Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.  Private sector analysts significantly revised down their projections for corporate earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2019 as a whole.  Growth of C I loans on banks balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales.  Although commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) spreads were volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, and issuance of both agency and non agency CMBS remained strong.  Purchase mortgage origination activity continued to decline modestly through November, while refinancing activity continued to be muted.  In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending.  However, the increase in volatility in financial markets in December was viewed as substantial and as likely exacerbated by thin year end liquidity, among other factors.  Staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the period since the assessment presented in the November 2018 financial stability report.  Staff continued to monitor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year.  The build up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector.  The unemployment rate was projected to decline somewhat further below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021.  With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.  On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, supported by a strong job market and rising incomes.  Participants observed that the recent partial federal government shutdown had presented a significant hardship for many families.  A few participants also pointed to continued weakness in the housing sector, which was attributed in part to concerns about affordability among potential homebuyers.  Some participants highlighted that recent surveys of business sentiment or District contacts had indicated some weakening in optimism or confidence about the economic outlook, though available indicators suggested that the level of business sentiment had remained high.  Continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor necessary to support rising real wages over time.  Among those participants who commented on financial stability, a number expressed concerns about the elevated financial market volatility and the apparent decline in investors willingness to bear risk that occurred toward the end of last year.  A few participants highlighted the importance of ensuring that financial institutions were able to withstand adverse financial market events for instance, by maintaining adequate levels of capital.  Financial market volatility had remained elevated over the intermeeting period, and, despite some easing since the December FOMC meeting, overall financial conditions had tightened since September.  Based on their current assessments, all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 percent.  The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate.  Several other participants indicated that, if the economy evolved as they expected, they would view it as appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data.  The statement language was revised to indicate that the Committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as the most likely outcomes.  Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 percent.","id":39},{"text":" 3.  6.","id":39},{"text":" Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.","id":40},{"text":" The deputy manager followed with a discussion of money market developments and open market operations.  Survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.  Measures of inflation compensation generally fell, partly reflecting sharp decreases in oil prices.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized real PCE growth as remaining strong.  A few participants expressed concern that longer run inflation expectations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.","id":40},{"text":"Long Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks Committee participants resumed their discussion from the November 2018 FOMC meeting of potential long run frameworks for monetary policy implementation.  The staff also discussed new ceiling tools that could help keep the EFFR within the Committee s target range, including options that would add new counterparties for the Open Market Desk s operations.  In discussing the transition to a long run operating regime, participants commented on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing reserves to decline to a level that could put noticeable upward pressure on the federal funds rate, at least for a time.  These considerations suggested that it might be appropriate to instead provide a buffer of reserves sufficient to ensure that the Federal Reserve operates consistently on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve so as to promote the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.  Several participants commented on options that rely on existing or currently used tools, such as further technical adjustments to the IOER rate to keep the federal funds rate within the target range or using the discount window, although such options were recognized to have limitations in some situations.  Participants commented on the role that the Federal Reserve s nonreserve liabilities have played in the expansion of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet since the financial crisis.  Many participants noted that the magnitudes of these nonreserve liabilities most significantly currency but also liabilities to the Treasury through the Treasury General Account and liabilities to foreign official institutions through their accounts at the Federal Reserve are not closely related to Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.  In discussing the long run level of reserve liabilities, participants noted that it might be useful to explore ways to encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves and to provide information to banks and the public about the likely long run level of reserves.  The revision in the expected policy path was less noticeable in the Desk s survey based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate.  After a fast narrowing of the spread between the IOER rate and the EFFR before the November meeting, the EFFR had remained stable at, or just 1 basis point below the level of the IOER rate since then.  Some upward pressures on overnight rates were evident in the repurchase agreement (repo) market, apparently from higher issuance of Treasury bills and an associated expansion of primary dealer inventories over the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 18 19 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real GDP growth was strong.  Automakers assembly schedules suggested that production of light motor vehicles would rise in December, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in total factory output in the coming months.  Key factors that influence consumer spending including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values on households net worth continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  Real residential investment appeared to be declining further in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part the effects of the rise in mortgage interest rates over the past year on the affordability of housing.  Real purchases by state and local governments looked to be only edging up, as nominal construction spending by these governments rose solidly in October but their payrolls declined a little in October and November.  Available trade data suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed on balance.  Remarks by Federal Reserve officials over the intermeeting period were interpreted by market participants as signaling a shift in the stance of policy toward a more gradual path of federal funds rate increases.  The United States dollar appreciated modestly; although declines in United States yields weighed on the dollar, deteriorating global risk sentiment provided support.  The EFFR held steady at or very close to the level of the IOER rate, while take up in the overnight reverse repo facility remained near historically low levels.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on net, though funding conditions for capital markets tightened somewhat as spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds widened to near the middle of their historical distribution.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds also moderated in November, driven by a significant step down in speculative grade bond issuance, while institutional leveraged loan issuance also slowed in November.  Broad consumer credit grew at a solid pace through September, though October and November saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit lower on average.  With labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  Several participants noted that business fixed investment remained solid despite a slowdown in the third quarter, as more recent data pointed to a rebound in investment spending.  A couple of participants commented that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a weakening in global demand that could weigh on capital spending by oil production companies and affect companies providing services to the oil industry.  However, a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil supply rather than softening global demand.  Although a few participants pointed to anecdotal and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and pass through of these higher costs to consumer prices, reports from business contacts and surveys in some other Districts suggested some moderation in inflationary pressure.  Some participants commented that these developments may reflect an increased focus among market participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of trade tensions or could be a signal of a significant slowdown in the pace of economic growth in the future.  Based on their current assessments, most participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Participants discussed ideas for effectively communicating to the public the Committee s data dependent approach, including options for transitioning away from forward guidance language in future postmeeting statements.  Several participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to remove forward guidance entirely and replace it with language emphasizing the data dependent nature of policy decisions.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data.  The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.","id":40},{"text":" Additionally, participants cited the social benefits provided by these liabilities to the economy.  Participants expected to continue their discussion of long run implementation frameworks and related issues at upcoming meetings.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still close to the lows reached in late 2007.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November.  Output increased in the mining and utilities sectors, while manufacturing production edged down on balance.  The pace of light motor vehicle sales edged down in November but stayed near its recent elevated level.  Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases.  Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit but generally remained supportive of economic growth.  Issuance of non agency CMBS was stable while CRE loan growth remained strong at banks.  Although household spending overall was seen as strong, several participants noted continued weakness in residential investment.  Contacts in many Districts continued to report tight labor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers.

However, respondents to the Desk s recent Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that they anticipated the reduction in the supply of reserves in the banking system could become a very important factor influencing the spread between the IOER rate and the EFFR over the last three quarters of next year.  Following the Desk briefings, the Chairman noted the upward trend in the EFFR relative to the IOER rate over the intermeeting period and suggested that it might be appropriate to implement another technical adjustment in the IOER rate relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate fairly soon.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the November 7 8 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the first half of the year.  Total labor compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2.8 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, the employment cost index for private workers increased 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in October.","id":41},{"text":" The manager also reviewed recent developments in global markets.

In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.","id":41},{"text":" Growth in home purchase mortgage originations slowed over the past year as mortgage rates stayed near their highest level since 2011, and refinancing activity continued to be very muted.  In general, participants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation would remain near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.  A few participants indicated that uncertainty had increased recently, pointing to the high levels of uncertainty regarding the effects of fiscal and trade policies on economic activity and inflation.","id":41},{"text":" Further out, the median of survey respondents modal expectations for the path of the federal funds rate pointed to about three additional policy firmings next year while futures quotes appeared to be pricing in a somewhat flatter trajectory.  Production worker hours in the manufacturing sector increased in October, automakers assembly schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production would rise in the fourth quarter, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to solid gains in factory output in the near term.  Key factors that influence consumer spending including solid gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values on households net worth continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  Based on recent readings on spending, prices, and the labor market, participants generally indicated little change in their assessment of the economic outlook, with above trend economic growth expected to continue before slowing to a pace closer to trend over the medium term.  A couple of participants saw scope for further increases in the labor force participation rate as the strong economy pulled more workers into the labor market, while a couple of other participants judged that there was little scope for significant further increases.  Some participants raised the concern that tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an increase in the ability of firms to pass through increases in tariffs or in other input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation.  In their discussion of financial developments, participants observed that financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as equity prices declined, longer term yields and borrowing costs for most sectors increased, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  Financial conditions, although somewhat tighter than at the time of the September FOMC meeting, had stayed accommodative overall, while the effects of expansionary fiscal policies enacted over the past year were expected to continue through the medium term.","id":41},{"text":" This technique worked well before the financial crisis, when reserve demand was fairly stable in the aggregate and largely influenced by payment needs and reserve requirements.  The EFFR along with other overnight rates edged higher over the weeks following the increase in the target range at the previous meeting.  Exports decreased in August but more than recovered in September, reflecting the pattern of industrial supplies exports.  Medium and longer term nominal Treasury yields ended the period higher amid some moderate volatility over the intermeeting period.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid, though there were some signs of modest deterioration.  Many participants noted that the recent pace of aggregate wage gains was broadly consistent with trends in productivity growth and inflation.  Despite these developments, a number of participants judged that financial conditions remained accommodative relative to historical norms.","id":41},{"text":" The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent.

Nominal defense spending in July and August was consistent with continued increases in real federal purchases.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance.  Short term funding markets functioned smoothly over the intermeeting period.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds continued to be solid.  Recent data suggested that household spending and business fixed investment grew strongly.  Indicators of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.  Participants noted that business fixed investment had grown strongly so far this year.

In particular, some contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs.","id":42},{"text":" Domestic stock prices rose, buoyed in part by positive news about corporate earnings, while foreign equity indexes declined and the broad dollar index moved up.  A couple of participants commented that recent strong growth in GDP may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economy s productive capacity.

Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and survey based measures of credit demand among small business owners showed signs of strengthening, although demand was still weak relative to pre crisis levels.  With regard to residential investment, a few participants noted weak residential construction activity at the national or District level, which was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply constraints.  Almost all considered that it was also appropriate to revise the Committee s postmeeting statement in order to remove the language stating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.","id":42},{"text":" Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 25 26 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a strong rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the first half of the year.  Automakers assembly schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production would be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, although broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid gains in factory output in the near term.  Forward looking indicators of business equipment spending such as increases in new and unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional surveys pointed to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term.  Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined in July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector held about steady in recent weeks.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Nominal Treasury yields increased over the intermeeting period, as market reactions to domestic economic data releases that were, on balance, slightly stronger than expected appeared to outweigh ongoing concerns about trade policy and negative developments in some EMEs.  Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic forecast prepared for the September FOMC meeting, real GDP was projected to increase in the second half of this year at a rate that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year.  The staff s preliminary assessment was that the effects of Hurricane Florence would lead to a slight reduction in real GDP growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity returned to more normal levels and some disrupted activity was made up.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in August indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity rose at a strong rate.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong, and they judged that robust increases in disposable income, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending.  For the economy overall, participants generally agreed that, on balance, recent data suggested some acceleration in labor costs, but that wage growth remained moderate by historical standards, which was due in part to tepid productivity growth.  In their discussion of developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative The rise in interest rates and appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period had been offset by increases in equity prices, and broader measures continued to point to accommodative financial conditions.  In addition, waiting until the target range for the federal funds rate had been increased further to remove the characterization of the policy stance as accommodative could convey a false sense of precision in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding all estimates of the neutral federal funds rate.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in August indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.","id":42},{"text":" Trade tensions weighed on foreign equity prices, as the United States continued its trade negotiations with Canada and placed additional tariffs on Chinese products.

On a 12 month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.

The deputy manager also discussed the Desk s plans for small value purchases of agency mortgage backed securities (MBS).  Sales of existing homes edged down in May and June, while sales of new homes moved up on balance.  Participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the Committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.","id":43},{"text":" In the discussion that followed the staff s briefing, participants generally agreed that their current toolkit could provide significant accommodation but expressed concern about the potential limits on policy effectiveness stemming from the ELB.  That decline was viewed as likely driven by various factors, including slower trend growth of the labor force and productivity as well as increased demand for safe assets.  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period.  The rate of private sector job openings ticked down in May but remained elevated, while the rate of quits moved higher; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through mid July.  The issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter, which suggested that starts might move lower in coming months.  After the June FOMC meeting, the EFFR rose around 20 basis points, in line with the increase in the IOER rate, and traded well within the target range throughout the period.  Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic forecast prepared for this FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an above trend pace.  Real GDP was forecast to increase in the second half of this year at a pace that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year.  Several participants stressed the possibility that real GDP growth in the second quarter may have been boosted by transitory factors, including an outsized increase in United States exports.  Payrolls had grown strongly in June, and labor market tightness was reflected in recent readings on rates of private sector job openings and quits and on job to job switching by workers.  Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn.  With regard to the medium term, various participants indicated that information gathered since the Committee met in June had not significantly altered their outlook for the United States economy.  Many participants reiterated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would ultimately depend on the incoming data and on how those data affect the economic outlook.","id":43},{"text":" The staff s analysis indicated that under various policy rules, including those prescribing aggressive reductions in the federal funds rate in response to adverse economic shocks, there was a meaningful risk that the ELB could bind sometime during the next decade.  A couple of participants saw macroprudential and regulatory policies as tools that could be used to mitigate the risk of financial imbalances inducing an economic downturn in which the ELB constrained the federal funds rate.  A number of participants indicated that there might be significant costs associated with the use of unconventional policies, and that these costs might limit, in particular, the extent to which the Committee should engage in large scale asset purchases.  Moreover, although making multiyear commitments regarding asset purchases or the future path of the federal funds rate could enhance the effectiveness of these policies, such commitments could unduly constrain the choices of the Committee in the future.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the July 31 August 1 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong rate in the first half of the year.  Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained near their post crisis lows, while issuance of non agency and agency CMBS maintained a solid pace in the second quarter.  Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and continued high levels of household and business confidence.  Among other factors, they pointed to uncertainty about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the longer run and to constraints on the provision of monetary accommodation during ELB episodes as reasons for proceeding gradually in the removal of accommodation.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p.m. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.","id":43},{"text":" Many participants commented on the monetary policy implications of the apparent secular decline in neutral real interest rates.  The Japanese yield curve steepened following reports that the BOJ may facilitate an increase in longer term interest rates.  The deputy manager followed with a discussion of money markets and open market operations.  Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace again in June.  Total real government purchases rose at a faster rate in the second quarter than in the first.  The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat during the intermeeting period.  On the downside, trade policies could move in a direction that would have significant negative effects on economic growth.  Furthermore, recent tariff increases had put upward pressure on input prices.  The yield curve had flattened further over the intermeeting period.  The Chairman suggested that the Committee would likely resume a discussion of operating frameworks in the fall.","id":43},{"text":" Consistent with that view, a few participants noted that economic researchers had not yet reached a consensus about the effectiveness of unconventional policies.

The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.","id":43},{"text":" Concerns about international trade disputes led to a slight decline in sentiment toward some domestic risky assets early in the period, but sentiment was buoyed later by positive corporate earnings releases for the second quarter.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds and institutional leveraged loans picked up in May and stayed strong in June, with the rise in corporate bond issuance concentrated in the investment grade segment of the market.","id":43},{"text":" However, several participants cautioned against being too specific about how the Committee would deploy such tools.  Escalating trade tensions contributed to an unusually sharp depreciation of the Chinese renminbi.  For borrowers with low credit scores, credit conditions continued to ease but stayed tight overall.  Moreover, wide ranging tariff increases would also reduce the purchasing power of United States households.  Participants noted that the federal funds rate was moving closer to the range of estimates of its neutral level.","id":43},{"text":" Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property rose at a moderate pace in the second quarter after a strong gain in the first quarter.  The BOJ issued revised forward guidance at its July meeting indicating that it intends to maintain current low short and long term interest rates for an extended period.","id":43},{"text":" Total industrial production was little changed, on net, from April to June despite solid increases in the output of the mining sector.  On balance, market based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate through the end of 2019 edged up slightly.","id":43},{"text":" In the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans statement issued in June 2017, the Committee indicated that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.  Over the days following the June FOMC meeting, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) moved up relative to the IOER rate, reportedly reflecting some special factors in the federal funds market, including increased demand for overnight funding by banks in connection with liquidity regulations and a pullback by Federal Home Loan Banks in their lending in the federal funds market.  The employment cost index for private workers increased 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June (compared with 2.4 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier), and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2.7 percent over that period (compared with 2.5 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier).  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in May and June, and forward looking indicators of business equipment spending such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional surveys continued to point to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term.","id":43},{"text":" Yields on medium and longer term nominal Treasury securities were little changed.

In light of the firmness in repo rates, the volume of operations conducted through the Federal Reserve s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility remained low.  Elevated repo rates may also have contributed to some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate in recent weeks as lenders in that market shifted some of their investments to earn higher rates available in repo markets.  Consistent with the June 2017 addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, reinvestment purchases of agency MBS then are projected to fall to zero from that point onward.  In light of this possibility, the deputy manager described plans for the Desk to conduct small value purchases of agency MBS on a regular basis in order to maintain operational readiness.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 12 13 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months, and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a solid rate in the first half of the year.  In addition, the lower tax withholding resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year still appeared likely to provide some additional impetus to spending in coming months.  Real state and local government purchases also appeared to be moving up; al though nominal construction expenditures by these governments edged down in April, their payrolls rose at a moderate pace, on net, in April and May.  Net exports made a negligible contribution to real GDP growth in the first quarter, with growth of both real exports and real imports slowing from the brisk pace of the fourth quarter of last year.  After narrowing in March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed further in April, as exports continued to increase while imports declined slightly, which suggested that net exports might add modestly to real GDP growth in the second quarter.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed on balance.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation During the intermeeting period, global financial markets were buffeted by increased concerns about the outlook for foreign growth and political developments in Italy, but these concerns subsequently eased.  These developments, together with a still solid economic outlook for the United States, supported an increase in the broad trade weighted index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggested that the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the June FOMC meeting inched up further to near certainty.  Over the intermeeting period, short term funding markets stayed generally stable despite still elevated spreads between rates on some private money market instruments and OIS rates of similar maturity.  While some of the factors contributing to pressures in short term funding markets had eased recently, the three month spread between the London interbank offered rate and the OIS rate remained significantly wider than at the start of the year.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first few months of 2018, on balance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending.  Staff Economic Outlook In the United States economic forecast prepared for the June FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an above trend pace.  Real GDP appeared to be rising at a much faster pace in the second quarter than in the first, and it was forecast to increase at a solid rate in the second half of this year.  In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Incoming data suggested that GDP growth strengthened in the second quarter of this year, as growth of consumer spending picked up after slowing earlier in the year.  Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and continued high levels of household and business confidence.  Higher oil prices were expected to continue to support investment in that sector, and District contacts in the industry were generally upbeat, though supply constraints for labor and infrastructure were reportedly limiting expansion plans.  Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity.  Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.  Participants also discussed a staff presentation of an indicator of the likelihood of recession based on the spread between the current level of the federal funds rate and the expected federal funds rate several quarters ahead derived from futures market prices.  Based on their current assessments, almost all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to continue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  With regard to the postmeeting statement, members favored the removal of the forward guidance language stating that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  Members noted that, al though this forward guidance language had been useful for communicating the expected path of the federal funds rate during the early stages of policy normalization, this language was no longer appropriate in light of the strong state of the economy and the current expected path for policy.","id":44},{"text":" Since the target range was established in December 2008, the IOER rate has been set at the top of the target range to help keep the effective federal funds rate within the range.

Total real government purchases rose at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.  Meanwhile, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households largely remained supportive of spending.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period.  In some cases, labor shortages were contributing to upward pressure on wages.  Several participants also saw scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce.  Some participants noted that inflation was likely to modestly overshoot 2 percent for a time.  Meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates.","id":45},{"text":" Judging from federal funds futures quotes, the expected path of the federal funds rate changed relatively little over the intermeeting period.  The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a rate close to that prevailing before the previous recession.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was stable over the intermeeting period, and the ratio of aggregate debt to assets remained near multidecade highs.  Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth quarter pace, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.  Participants commented on how the Committee s communications in its postmeeting statement might need to be revised in coming meetings if the economy evolved broadly as expected.  Participants expressed a range of views on the amount of further policy firming that would likely be required over the medium term to achieve the Committee s goals.  Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.","id":45},{"text":" The manager also discussed current projections for principal payments received from mortgage backed securities (MBS) held in the SOMA.  Recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation stepped up modestly over the past year.  CRE loan growth at banks strengthened in March but edged down in the first half of April.  CMBS issuance continued to be strong in March but slowed somewhat in April.  Both the overall labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio moved up.","id":45},{"text":" The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high levels of household and business confidence, favorable financial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","id":45},{"text":" Market participants pointed to a range of factors contributing to the decline in stock prices, including concerns about the outlook for trade policy both in the United States and abroad, the potential for increased regulatory oversight of United States technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth.  While some of the recent pressure on the federal funds rate could be expected to fade over coming weeks as the market adjusts to higher levels of Treasury bills, the gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet and the accompanying decline in reserves was anticipated to continue putting some upward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate.  Automakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would edge down in the second quarter from the average pace in the first quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, continued to point to further gains in factory output in the near term.  In the early part of the period, the index depreciated slightly, as relatively positive news about the current round of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) negotiations led to appreciation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, two currencies with large weights in the index.  The staff judged vulnerabilities from financial sector leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation to be low, vulnerabilities from household leverage as being in the low to moderate range, and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as elevated.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  In commenting on the staff s assessment of financial stability, a couple of participants noted that after the bout of financial market volatility in early February, the use of investment strategies predicated on a low volatility environment may have become less prevalent, and that some investors may have become more cautious.","id":45},{"text":" The labor force participation rate held steady in January and then stepped up markedly in February, with the participation rates for prime age (defined as ages 25 to 54) women and men moving up on net.  The upward pressure on money market rates also showed up in slight increases in the effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.  Longer term yields on sovereign debt in AFEs either decreased moderately or ended the period little changed, in contrast to the increase in United States Treasury yields.  In the United Kingdom, longer term yields were little changed, on net, al though the market based path of expected policy rates moved up moderately in response to Bank of England communications.  (The Venezuelan government devalued the official Venezuelan exchange rate by more than 99 percent against the dollar, bringing the official rate closer to its black market value.)  The firmness in the overall participation rate relative to its demographically driven downward trend and the rising participation rate of prime age adults were regarded as signs of continued strengthening in labor market conditions.  In their discussion of developments in financial markets, some participants observed that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in market volatility and repricing of assets that had occurred in February.  Based on their current assessments, almost all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.","id":46},{"text":" Automakers schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely edge down in coming months.  Real residential investment looked to be slowing in the first quarter after rising briskly in the fourth quarter.  Firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined in January.  Nominal defense spending in January and February was consistent with a decline in real federal purchases.  Subsequently, equity prices recovered about half of their decline, and the VIX partially retraced its earlier increase.  Small business owners continued to report accommodative credit supply conditions but also weak demand for credit.  Consumer credit grew at a solid pace in January following a rapid expansion in the fourth quarter.  A few participants noted that the changes in tax policy could boost the level of potential output.  All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months.

The slowing of real import growth following the rapid increase in the fourth quarter suggested that the drag on real GDP growth from net exports would lessen in the first quarter.  Real GDP growth picked up in Mexico but slowed a bit in some advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in emerging Asia.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.","id":46},{"text":"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period; she also reported on open market operations and related issues.  The spread of market rates on overnight repurchase agreements over the offering rate at the Federal Reserve s overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) facility widened, and take up at the facility fell to quite low levels as a result.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the March 20 21 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through February and suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a moderate pace in the first quarter.  Real PCE edged down in January, and the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose somewhat in February while the pace of light motor vehicle sales declined slightly.  However, recent forward looking indicators of business equipment spending such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional surveys pointed to further solid gains in equipment spending in the near term.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed on balance.  The near term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with residual seasonality in the data.  In their discussion of economic conditions and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen.  However, participants generally regarded the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of the fiscal policy changes as uncertain, partly because there have been few historical examples of expansionary fiscal policy being implemented when the economy was operating at a high level of resource utilization.  However, business contacts or national surveys led a few participants to conclude that some businesses facing labor shortages were changing job requirements so that they matched more closely the skills of available workers, increasing training, or offering more flexible work arrangements, rather than increasing wages in a broad based fashion.  Regarding wage growth at the national level, several participants noted a modest increase, but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat further.  Several participants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market conditions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt policy tightening.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate.  In addition, notwithstanding increased market volatility over the intermeeting period, financial conditions had stayed accommodative, and developments since the January meeting had indicated that fiscal policy was likely to provide greater impetus to the economy over the next few years than members had previously thought.","id":46},{"text":" Subject to reasonable limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow.

The Committee directs the Selected Bank to conduct testing of transactions for the purpose of operational readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization.  By unanimous vote, the Committee revised its Program for Security of FOMC Information with a set of technical changes to update references to other documents.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhancing the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the intermeeting period.  In this environment, yields on safe assets such as United States Treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further significant gains.  Breakeven measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) moved up but remained low.  Year end pressures were evident in the market for foreign exchange basis swaps, but conditions returned to normal early in 2018.  Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early March were elevated, reflecting investors concerns about the possibility that a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling could affect the timing of principal payments for these securities.  The deputy manager also reported on the volume of overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations over the intermeeting period and discussed the Desk s plans for small value operational tests of various types of open market operations over the coming year.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the models that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years.  The staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more competitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs.  Estimates of the strength of those effects had diminished noticeably in recent years.  With regard to inflation expectations, two of the briefings presented findings that the longer run trend in inflation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctuations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent.  Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curve type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 30 31 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through December and that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at about a 2 1/2 percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year.  Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in December.  The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for Asians, and for African Americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession.  The national labor force participation rate held steady in December; relative to the declining trend suggested by an aging population, this sideways movement in the participation rate represented a further strengthening in labor market conditions.  The participation rate for prime age (defined as ages 25 to 54) men edged up in December, while the rate for prime age women declined slightly.  The share of workers who were employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in December and was close to its pre recession level.  Both the employment cost index for private sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2 1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in December.  Automakers schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely move up over the coming months.  Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term.  Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households net worth continued to be supportive of further solid growth of real PCE in the near term.  Real residential investment rose briskly in the fourth quarter after having declined in the previous two quarters.  Both starts and issuance of building permits for new single family homes increased in the fourth quarter as a whole, and starts for multifamily units also moved up.  Increased federal government purchases mostly reflected a rise in defense spending, and the gains in purchases by state and local governments were led by an increase in construction spending in this sector.  Total United States consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in December.  Recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed on balance.  Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expansion was broad based across countries.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial market conditions eased considerably further over the intermeeting period.  In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and monetary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommodative than expected.  The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting period amid an improved outlook for domestic and foreign economic growth.  Broad equity price indexes rose substantially over the intermeeting period, with investors pointing to a stronger global economic outlook and the supportive effect of the recently enacted tax legislation on risk sentiment.  Spreads of both investment and speculative grade corporate bond yields over comparable maturity Treasury yields declined slightly and remained well below their historical averages.  The effective federal funds rate held steady at a level near the middle of the target range except at year end.  While borrowing costs moved up briefly in offshore dollar funding markets over year end, conditions in money markets were reported to be orderly.  The broad nominal dollar index declined nearly 4 percent relative to its value at the time of the December FOMC meeting; the decline was most pronounced against AFE currencies, but the dollar depreciated notably against most EME currencies as well.  EME equity prices registered substantial gains, in part supported by a significant rise in commodity prices; emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately, and flows into EME equity and bond funds strengthened substantially.  The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate at its January meeting, largely in response to better than expected economic data.  Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of economic activity.  Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported easing standards and narrowing loan spreads for large and middle market firms and attributed this easing to more aggressive competition from other bank or nonbank lenders.  Net debt financing by investment grade nonfinancial corporations turned negative in December, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after tax cash flows and repa triation of foreign earnings.  Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative despite sluggish credit growth among these firms.  Financing conditions in the commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) market remained accommodative as issuance continued at a robust pace and spreads on CMBS remained near their lowest levels since the financial crisis.  Credit conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative for most borrowers, though credit standards remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or hard to document incomes.  Mortgage rates increased in tandem with rates on longer term Treasury securities but remained quite low by historical standards.  Consumer credit increased notably in November, exceeding the more moderate volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year.  This overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated; asset valuation pressures apparently reflected, in part, a broad based appetite for risk among investors.  The staff judged that vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate, while vulnerabilities stemming from financial sector leverage and from maturity and liquidity transformation continued to be viewed as low.  Real GDP was projected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than potential output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real GDP growth moderately over the medium term.  These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate.  They pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the recently enacted tax legislation, and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters.  Participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong.  Participants expected the recent solid growth in consumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income, increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices, and high levels of consumer confidence.  Participants characterized their business contacts as generally upbeat about the economy; their contacts cited the recent tax cuts and notable improvements in the global economic outlook as positive factors.  Against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil, a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for energy production in their respective Districts.  While some participants heard more reports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad based pickup in wage growth in available data.  With regard to how firms might use part of their tax savings to boost compensation, a few participants suggested that such a boost could be in the form of onetime bonuses or variable pay rather than a permanent increase in wage structures.  Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.  Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.  That said, a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain market share, which could result in a transitory drag on inflation.  In this environment, increased use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions might be difficult to detect in a timely manner.  In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.  While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further.  By most estimates, the neutral level of the federal funds rate had been very low in recent years, but it was expected to rise slowly over time toward its longer run level.  For example, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the Global Financial Crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run.  Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.","id":47},{"text":" 3.  6.","id":47},{"text":" On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment to population ratio was unchanged.

There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity.  Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net.  Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro area peripheral countries widened further.  In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.  Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services.  Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy.  One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points.  Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter.","id":12},{"text":" Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up.  Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates.  The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period.  In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent.  Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer run rate of 2 percent.  And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.  Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID 19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth.  While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below prime credit scores inched up from low levels.  They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve s goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.  With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook.  Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity.  While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.  Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector.  All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May.  In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.  Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percent.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Reinvest into agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.  In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in May.","id":12},{"text":" Market based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period.  Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments.  One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials.  On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.  Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.","id":12},{"text":" On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.  The private sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level.  In addition, participants indicated that COVID related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.","id":12},{"text":" Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the March increase in the Federal Reserve s administered rates passing through to overnight money market rates.  The considerable increases in Treasury yields across maturities over the intermeeting period were associated with rising interest rates faced by households, particularly rates on home mortgages.","id":13},{"text":" In global financial developments, many advanced economy central banks raised policy rates over the period, and investors increasingly came to anticipate tighter monetary policy ahead in most advanced foreign economies.  In addition to the detailed review of open market operations over 2021, the report would include updated illustrative projections of the size and composition of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet over coming years.  Participants observed that developments associated with Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the COVID related lockdowns in China posed heightened risks for both the United States and economies around the world.  Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong.","id":13},{"text":" The manager expected that ON RRP usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that, over the longer term, usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded.  In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and COVID related lockdowns in China were seen as likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.","id":13},{"text":" The median Desk survey respondents also projected 50 basis point increases in the target range at the two following meetings and another 125 basis points of increases by the middle of next year, bringing the projected midpoint of the target range to a peak of 3.13 percent substantially higher than in previous surveys.  The manager indicated that the Desk was prepared to implement the Committee s plan for balance sheet reduction and that, in the event that the Committee announced the plan at the end of the current meeting, the Desk would issue a statement and FAQs providing the public with details regarding the implementation of the plan.  In their discussion of the economic outlook beyond the near term, participants indicated that they expected that output would expand more moderately this year than in 2021, with growth this year likely near or above its longer run rate, and that the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply would diminish over time.  Also mentioned were the risks associated with nominal wage growth continuing to run above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time and the extent to which households high savings since the onset of the pandemic and healthy balance sheets would support greater than expected underlying momentum in consumer spending and contribute to upside inflation pressures.  PLANS FOR REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE S BALANCE SHEET (as adopted effective May 4, 2022) Consistent with the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that were issued in January 2022, all Committee participants agreed to the following plans for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve s securities holdings.","id":13},{"text":" The dollar appreciated, leaving the broad trade weighted dollar up around 2 percent over the period.  The Bank of Japan was an exception and was widely anticipated to maintain its accommodative policies.  The renminbi depreciated against the dollar around 4 percent over the intermeeting period.  The Desk would closely monitor market conditions and update the Committee during the runoff process.  This additional information would provide the public with greater transparency about usage of the ON RRP facility.  The votes to renew the Federal Reserve s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  By contrast, real exports of goods fell back after rising briskly late last year, with broad based declines in most major categories.  Short term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased further.  The VIX declined substantially early in the period but ended the period little changed on net, remaining at elevated levels.  Credit remained widely available, and borrower credit quality continued to be strong overall.  Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased substantially, with the 30 year mortgage offer rates reaching levels not seen since 2010.  However, larger or prolonged disruptions in commodities markets could interfere with other markets and real activity more broadly.  To date, however, such potential spillovers appeared to be limited.  Households debt to GDP ratio remained relatively low, and there were few signs of increased stress among lower income households.  The staff assessed that vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage remained moderate on balance.  The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year.  Inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.  The ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks.  A few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hesitant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects.  Many participants indicated that they expected the labor market to remain tight and wage pressures to stay elevated for some time.  Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting.  Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings.  Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial market conditions.  Several participants commented on the challenges that monetary policy faced in restoring price stability while also maintaining strong labor market conditions.  Members also agreed that COVID related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.  For agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, the cap will initially be set at $17.5 billion per month and after three months will increase to $35 billion per month.  Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong.  In addition, COVID related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.","id":13},{"text":" Finally, the deputy manager requested that the Committee vote to maintain the standing United States dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico under the North American Framework Agreement.  Both real PCE and residential investment increased in the first quarter at rates similar to those seen in the fourth quarter of 2021. Business fixed investment growth picked up sharply in the first quarter, with spending on equipment and intellectual property products posting a large increase.  Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance rebounded sharply in March, mostly reflecting an increase in investment grade issuance, while gross institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed amid elevated geopolitical uncertainty.  In consumer credit markets, credit card balances grew strongly in the first quarter amid easing standards and greater utilization, and auto credit outstanding continued to grow steadily through February despite vehicle production shortfalls and low vehicle inventories.  Participants also agreed that it was appropriate to start reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that would be issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement.","id":13},{"text":" Goods imports continued the fourth quarter s strong growth, driven by large increases in real imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and automotive products.  They also noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook.","id":13},{"text":" Prospects of tighter monetary policy and COVID related lockdowns in China weighed on prices of risky assets, but investor concerns surrounding the economic effects of the war in Ukraine seemed to abate partially.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong.  Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory investment making large negative contributions to growth.  Many participants judged that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would leave the Committee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments.  The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon maturities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills.","id":13},{"text":" In the Treasury market, market depth fell and the price impact of trades increased modestly in some sectors.  EME sovereign spreads widened, and EME dedicated funds experienced moderate portfolio outflows, which increased after the Russian invasion.  However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight.","id":14},{"text":" Market participants expected the interest on reserve balances rate and overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate to be increased by 25 basis points at the current meeting, in line with their expected increase in the target range, and anticipated that the changes would fully pass through to market overnight interest rates.  Plans for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet Participants continued their discussion of topics related to plans for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet in a manner consistent with the approach described in the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet that the Committee released following its January meeting.  Against this backdrop, participants generally agreed that it would be appropriate to first slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances were above the level the Committee judged to be consistent with ample reserves, thereby allowing reserves to decline more gradually as nonreserve liabilities increased over time.  No decision regarding the Committee s plan to reduce the Federal Reserve s balance sheet was made at this meeting, but participants agreed they had made substantial progress on the plan and that the Committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May.  Delinquency rates for commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) collateralized by hotel and retail properties continued to decline in January but remained well above pre pandemic levels, while those for CMBS in the office sector increased somewhat in January but remained fairly low by historical standards.  The upward revision reflected the staff s reaction to the persistently high and broad based levels of domestic inflation, import price inflation, and wage growth that had been observed, as well as the staff s expectation that the upward pressure on inflation from supply and demand imbalances would last longer than previously assumed.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine was perceived as adding to the uncertainty around the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as the conflict carried the risk of further exacerbating supply chain disruptions and of putting additional upward pressure on inflation by boosting the prices for energy, food, and other key commodities.","id":14},{"text":" Consistent with shifting expectations for the path of policy, shorter dated Treasury yields rose notably over the intermeeting period and the spread between the 10 year Treasury yield and 2 year Treasury yield narrowed.  Participants generally agreed that after balance sheet runoff was well under way, it will be appropriate to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities.  The COVID 19 pandemic remained a source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as posing an additional downside risk to activity and an upside risk to inflation.  Participants remarked that recent inflation readings continued to significantly exceed the Committee s longer run goal and noted that developments associated with Russia s invasion of Ukraine, including the related surge in energy prices, will add to near term inflation pressures.  Participants also agreed that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet would play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy and that they expected it would be appropriate to begin this process at a coming meeting, possibly as soon as in May.  These participants suggested that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would reduce this risk while also leaving the Committee well positioned to adjust the stance of policy if geopolitical and other developments led to a more rapid dissipation of demand pressures than expected.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.3 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.","id":14},{"text":" For Treasury securities, the Desk would follow the usual practice of rolling over all principal payments at auctions.  The volumes of credit rating upgrades for corporate and municipal bonds outpaced those of downgrades moderately in January and February.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.","id":14},{"text":" While oil prices partially retraced late in the period, options prices suggested considerable probability that oil prices could remain elevated or rise further in the months ahead.  Overnight interest rates were steady throughout the period, but there were some signs of pressures in term funding markets.  Incoming data suggested that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant had tempered the foreign recovery around the turn of the year.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to periods of particularly elevated volatility and deteriorating investor risk sentiment.  Short term funding markets were mostly stable over the intermeeting period, although spreads in some segments widened.  In domestic credit markets, credit remained broadly available for most types of borrowers during the intermeeting period.","id":14},{"text":" Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of an array of sanctions, the ruble depreciated roughly 40 percent against the dollar.  Over the longer term, however, ON RRP balances were expected to decline as the Federal Reserve s balance sheet runoff proceeded and gradually lifted money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.  Nonfinancial gross corporate bond issuance slowed noticeably in January and February, reflecting lower demand for credit due to rising borrowing costs and elevated issuance over the past two years.  Information on borrowing costs through February and early March suggested that the events surrounding Russia s invasion of Ukraine did not have a significant effect on financing conditions during the intermeeting period.  Participants commented that demand for labor continued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.  Participants agreed that developments surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the resulting sanctions, were adding to inflation pressures and posing upside risks to the inflation outlook.  With regard to reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet, all members agreed that they had made substantial progress on arriving at a plan specifying the steps the Committee would take.","id":14},{"text":" Prices of dollar denominated Russian bonds plunged 80 to 90 percent, and local trading of Russian equities was suspended after a precipitous decline in Russian stock price indexes.  The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.","id":14},{"text":" The manager turned next to a discussion of money markets and policy implementation.  Financing conditions remained accommodative, although borrowing costs increased further.  Liquidity conditions became strained in some financial markets during the intermeeting period.  Leveraged loan issuance was strong in January and February.  Credit quality in the commercial real estate sector continued to show some signs of stress.","id":14},{"text":" All of the options featured a more rapid pace of balance sheet runoff than in the 2017 19 episode.  Consistent with a tight labor market, nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in many years.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.","id":14},{"text":" Participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve s securities holdings should be reduced over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the SOMA.  Most participants judged that it would be appropriate to redeem coupon securities up to the cap amount each month and to redeem Treasury bills in months when Treasury coupon principal payments were below the cap.  A couple of participants commented that holding some Treasury bills could be appropriate if the Federal Reserve wished to keep its Treasury portfolio neutral with respect to the universe of outstanding Treasury securities.  Equity prices increased early in the period because of stronger than anticipated corporate earnings and economic data releases, but they retraced these gains as investor risk sentiment deteriorated following the Ukraine invasion.  For 2022 as a whole, real GDP growth was projected to step down markedly from its rapid 2021 pace before picking up slightly in 2023 as the continued resolution of supply constraints provided a small boost to growth.

The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively.  The invasion had also exacerbated the disruptions of supply chains.  Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions must take account of the state of financial markets and the economy.","id":14},{"text":" Undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and ii.

Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securities with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Customer Accounts; and ii.  The Committee authorizes the Chair of the Committee, in fostering the Committee s objectives during any period between meetings of the Committee, to instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Committee to A.

The Chair, whenever feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph.  The Committee directs the Selected Bank to maintain, for the System Open Market Account 4.  The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Committee regarding the management of the foreign currency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authorization.  The Committee voted unanimously to approve with minor revisions the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility Resolution, as shown below.  All but one member of the Committee voted to approve with minor revisions the Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution.  The resolutions were modified to remove references to a specific facility rate to allow for normal adjustment in the facility rates when the Committee makes changes to the target range for the federal funds rate.  These operations shall be conducted by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Committee.  The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders.  Noting the urgency in bringing the new policy to completion, the Chair proposed that the Committee vote on a final draft as soon in the intermeeting period as possible.  Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average.  Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past.  The Committee judges that longer term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhance the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  Expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead, as well as an easing of COVID related concerns, were cited as contributing to the increase in yields.  The median survey projection for the commencement of balance sheet runoff shifted into the third quarter of this year, roughly a year and a half sooner than in the December surveys.  Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted toward earlier rate increases, and interest rate futures priced in an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC meeting.  The median survey projection for the most likely level of the target range at the end of 2024 was about 2 percent, similar to December.  Nonetheless, survey respondents attached significant probability to outcomes in which the target range moved up more than indicated by the projected modal path.  Several central banks concluded their net asset purchases late last year, and more were expected to do so this year.  On the outlook for policy rates, several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were expected to do so later this year.  The manager discussed expectations for the evolution of the Federal Reserve s administered rates in connection with a potential future change in the target range for the federal funds rate.  The Desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate.  No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  At this meeting, participants discussed high level principles that could be released to the public to describe the Committee s approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  Participants judged that the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction would be determined so as to promote the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals and that it would be appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun.  While participants agreed that details on the timing and pace of balance sheet runoff would be determined at upcoming meetings, participants generally noted that current economic and financial conditions would likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the period of balance sheet reduction from 2017 to 2019.  Consequently, market conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longer run level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet.  While no decisions regarding specific details for reducing the size of the balance sheet were made at this meeting, participants agreed to continue their discussions at upcoming meetings.  The Committee voted unanimously to adopt the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve s Balance Sheet, as shown below.  The Committee will determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet so as to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The Committee expects that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet will commence after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun.  In the longer run, the Committee intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the SOMA, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  Business fixed investment appeared to post only a small gain in the fourth quarter, as investment in transportation equipment was held back by supply bottlenecks and limited supplies of construction materials restrained nonresidential structures investment.  Motor vehicle assemblies reversed some of their November increase; in addition, manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles ticked lower.  Al though available data suggested that real federal purchases rose, indicators of real state and local government purchases pointed to a decline in the fourth quarter despite state and local governments extremely strong budget positions and the widespread return to in person schooling last fall.  Imports of goods rose sharply in November and December, led by increases in consumer goods, while exports of goods were little changed over the two months, on net, after surging in October.  Shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods.  Meanwhile, services exports jumped in November, reflecting a sizable increase in exports of travel services after the reopening of United States borders to vaccinated foreign travelers early in the month.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to improved supplier delivery times, and foreign vehicle production rose notably, suggesting that supply bottlenecks continued to ease somewhat.  Inflation abroad continued to rise, mostly driven by further increases in retail energy prices, effects from supply bottlenecks, and, in some emerging market economies (EMEs), by rising food prices.  Short term funding markets were stable, while participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased further.  Market based financing conditions remained accommodative, and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories.  The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively.  Some market participants also pointed to rising geopolitical tensions related to Russia as contributing to the moves.  In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained broadly accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained solid but slowed somewhat in December, reflecting seasonal factors.  Trailing default rates on nonfinancial bonds edged down further to historical lows, while market indicators of future expected default rates remained benign and historically low.  Issuance of non agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) surged in the fourth quarter, while issuance of agency CMBS slowed.  In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.  Mortgage rates increased over the intermeeting period in line with rates on agency MBS and 10 year Treasury securities but remained low by historical standards.  Financing conditions for consumer credit remained accommodative for most borrowers, especially those with higher credit scores.  With sales running low because of constrained supply, auto loan growth continued to slow in October and November from the more rapid pace recorded in the first half of the year.  The staff noted that the market capitalization of crypto assets had grown significantly over the past decade and had experienced considerable volatility, including sizable declines since late last year.  The staff changed its assessment of vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial leverage from notable to moderate, noting that measures of business leverage had declined to pre pandemic levels.  In contrast, some available measures of hedge fund leverage continued to increase, and important data gaps continued to limit a full assessment of vulnerabilities posed by many nonbank financial institutions.  Prime and tax exempt money funds continued to have structural vulnerabilities that may lead investors to withdraw funds quickly in a stress situation and were a potential source of spillovers to other short term funding markets.  In particular, the staff continued to expect that monthly inflation rates would move lower as supply constraints eased, but the projected step down was less pronounced than in the December forecast.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID 19 cases.  Participants judged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus.  Participants commented that, for many afflicted individuals and families, the virus continued to cause great hardship.  Participants cited strong household balance sheets, rising wages, and effective adaptation to the pandemic by the business sector as factors supporting the outlook for strong growth this year.  Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages had continued to limit businesses ability to meet strong demand, with these challenges exacerbated by the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant.  Some participants reported that their business contacts were hopeful that the effects of the Omicron wave would be relatively short lived.  Nevertheless, several participants reported that their contacts expected the ongoing labor shortages and other supply constraints to persist well after the acute effects of the Omicron wave had waned.  Participants contacts also reported continued widespread input cost pressures, which, amid generally robust demand, they reported having largely been able to pass on to their customers.  Participants noted that their District contacts were reporting that labor demand remained historically strong and that labor supply remained constrained, resulting in a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy.  Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability evolves over time, participants expressed a range of views regarding their assessments of current labor market conditions relative to the Committee s goal of maximum employment.  However, some participants commented that elevated inflation had broadened beyond sectors most directly affected by those factors, bolstered in part by strong consumer demand.  Participants acknowledged that elevated inflation was a burden on United States households, particularly those who were least able to pay higher prices for essential goods and services.  Some participants reported that their business contacts remained concerned about persistently high inflation and that they were adjusting their business practices to cope with higher input costs for instance, by raising output prices or utilizing contracts that were contingent on their costs.  A couple of these participants judged that prolonged accommodative financial conditions could be contributing to financial imbalances.  A couple of other participants cited reasons why elevated asset valuations might prove to be less of a threat to financial stability than in past reversals of asset prices.  Participants also assessed that the labor market was strong, having made substantial, broad based progress over the past year.  In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong labor market, participants continued to judge that the Committee s net asset purchases should be concluded soon.  Most participants preferred to continue to reduce the Committee s net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in December, bringing them to an end in early March.  Consequently, most participants suggested that a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than in the post 2015 period would likely be warranted, should the economy evolve generally in line with the Committee s expectation.  Participants noted that the removal of policy accommodation in current circumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet.  In this context, a number of participants commented that conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet sometime later this year.  Participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk management considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  In order to support the Committee s maximum employment and price stability objectives, members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  Members agreed to continue to reduce the monthly pace of the Committee s net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March.  Specifically, beginning in February, the Committee would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $10 billion per month.  Members noted that the Federal Reserve s ongoing asset purchases and holdings of securities would continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Members agreed to remove the opening sentence from previous postmeeting statements regarding using the Federal Reserve s full range of tools to support the United States economy.  Effective January 27, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $20 billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid February.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID 19 cases.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Federal Reserve s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.","id":15},{"text":" 3.  6.","id":15},{"text":" In addition to the effects of the pandemic on risk sentiment, some discussed the potential for COVID to become endemic, possibly resulting in modestly lower potential growth over time and a lower long run neutral level of the federal funds rate.  Market participants continued to focus on risks related to economic and financial developments in China, though near term concerns had moderated some following steps by Chinese authorities to ease policy.  Following the resolution, the Treasury was expected to increase bill issuance to restore the Treasury General Account to more normal levels.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  The staff then discussed some of the channels through which policy rate and balance sheet actions affect financial conditions and alternative ways these tools could be deployed to reduce policy accommodation in support of the Committee s macroeconomic goals.  The staff presentation included assessments of the implications for the yield curve of alternative settings of the two tools, the relative uncertainty of the effects of each tool, and the challenges associated with conducting and communicating policy with multiple tools.  Moreover, participants stated that the federal funds rate is a more familiar tool to the general public and therefore is advantageous for communication purposes.  A few participants also noted that when the federal funds rate is away from the effective lower bound (ELB), the Committee could more nimbly change interest rate policy than balance sheet policy in response to economic conditions.  They also observed that the Federal Reserve s balance sheet was much larger, both in dollar terms and relative to nominal gross domestic product (GDP), than it was at the end of the third large scale asset purchase program in late 2014.  Participants noted that the current weighted average maturity of the Federal Reserve s Treasury holdings was shorter than at the beginning of the previous normalization episode.  However, several participants raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the Treasury market and how those vulnerabilities could affect the appropriate pace of balance sheet normalization.  Participants had an initial discussion about the appropriate conditions and timing for starting balance sheet runoff relative to raising the federal funds rate from the ELB.  They also discussed how this relative timing might differ from the previous experience, in which balance sheet runoff commenced almost two years after policy rate liftoff when the normalization of the federal funds rate was judged to be well under way.  Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  However, participants judged that the appropriate timing of balance sheet runoff would likely be closer to that of policy rate liftoff than in the Committee s previous experience.  Some participants commented that removing policy accommodation by relying more on balance sheet reduction and less on increases in the policy rate could help limit yield curve flattening during policy normalization.  Many participants judged that the appropriate pace of balance sheet runoff would likely be faster than it was during the previous normalization episode.  Many participants also judged that monthly caps on the runoff of securities could help ensure that the pace of runoff would be measured and predictable, particularly given the shorter weighted average maturity of the Federal Reserve s Treasury security holdings.  Participants discussed considerations regarding the longer run size of the balance sheet consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy in an ample reserves regime.  Participants noted that the current size of the balance sheet is elevated and would likely remain so for some time after the process of normalizing the balance sheet was under way.  Participants noted that it would be important to carefully monitor developments in money markets as the level of reserves fell to help inform the Committee s eventual assessment of the appropriate level for the balance sheet in the longer run.  Consistent with the previous normalization principles, some participants expressed a preference for the Federal Reserve s asset holdings to consist primarily of Treasury securities in the longer run.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the December 14 15 meeting suggested that United States real GDP growth was picking up in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third quarter.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly, on average, in October and November, but the average gain was below that seen in recent quarters.  Light motor vehicle sales in October and November were below their third quarter average (though they were up, on net, relative to September), as extremely low dealer inventories continued to constrain sales.  Housing demand remained strong, but indicators of housing sector activity, including housing starts and home sales, were generally little changed in October.  Motor vehicle output moved up in October from its low level in September, as most assembly plants previously shuttered by semiconductor chip shortages had reopened.  The export rebound was broad based, with sizable increases in real exports of industrial supplies, capital goods, agricultural products, and consumer goods.  Strong gains in intra Asian trade and solid readings of purchasing managers indexes also provided some early signs that production bottlenecks in the region were easing.  In addition, cost pressures from persistent bottlenecks in supply and transportation were reflected in record high input and output price components of the purchasing managers indexes.  Pandemic related fears as well as concerns about inflation and tighter monetary policy apparently weighed on risky asset prices despite continued robust economic data.  Overall, financing conditions for businesses and households remained accommodative except for small businesses and nonprime borrowers.  Foreign asset prices fluctuated over the intermeeting period in response to central bank communications, headlines regarding COVID related restrictions in some countries, and the spread of the Omicron variant.  Emerging market economy (EME) sovereign spreads widened, and capital flows into EME dedicated funds turned slightly negative in the second half of November, partly in response to concerns about the Omicron variant.  A credit agency declared two heavily indebted Chinese property developers to be in restricted default, hurting asset prices in China s real estate sector, but spillovers to broader financial markets were limited.  Gross corporate bond issuance by both investment and speculative grade borrowers was solid, and gross leveraged loan issuance was robust.  In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions stayed accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.  Growth of credit card balances picked up in September and October, and bank credit data indicated a further increase in November.  Although aggregate demand appeared to be rising sharply in the fourth quarter, the emerging surge in COVID 19 caseloads and hospitalizations was expected to weigh on economic activity in the winter months.  With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023.  Given the higher forecast for inflation, the staff assumed monetary policy would be less accommodative in coming years and therefore revised down the medium term forecast for GDP somewhat.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  A few participants cited healthy household balance sheets, the need for businesses to rebuild inventory, and accommodative financial conditions as factors supporting continued robust growth.  Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages continued to limit businesses ability to meet strong demand.  A couple of participants reported that some contacts were implementing permanent changes in their business models to help weather current and future disruptions, including holding larger inventories or building domestic manufacturing capacity.  Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability may evolve over time, many participants saw the United States economy making rapid progress toward the Committee s maximum employment goal.  Some participants noted that trimmed mean measures of inflation had reached decade high levels and that the percentage of product categories with substantial price increases continued to climb.  Moreover, participants widely cited business contacts feeling confident that they would be able to pass on higher costs of labor and material to customers.  A few participants remarked that maximum employment consistent with price stability evolves over time and that further improvements in labor markets were likely over subsequent years as the economy continued to expand.  In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strengthening labor market, participants judged that the increase in policy accommodation provided by the ongoing pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary.  They remarked that a quicker conclusion of net asset purchases would better position the Committee to set policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes.  Such a change would result in reducing the monthly pace of net purchases of Treasury securities by $20 billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion starting in January.  Participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk management considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment.  Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the Committee s assessment of the progress the economy had made toward the criteria specified in its forward guidance for the target range for the federal funds rate.  Specifically, beginning in January, the Committee would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $40 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $20 billion per month.  Members also noted that the Federal Reserve s ongoing asset purchases and holdings of securities would continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit.  Effective December 16, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $40 billion and of agency MBS by $20 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid January.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee s assessments of maximum employment.  The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.","id":16},{"text":" Participants judged that several aspects of the previous approach remained applicable in the current environment.  In addition, supply bottlenecks were expected to resolve more gradually than previously assumed.","id":16},{"text":"Discussion of Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of global financial markets.  Some European Central Bank communications also suggested that market rates were likely not consistent with the outlook for policy.  In the United States, the market implied path of the federal funds rate rose, implying an earlier date for raising the target range for the federal funds rate and a faster pace of rate hikes than was the case in September.  Despite signs of robust risk appetite, market participants continued to note prominent risks to the outlook, including ongoing challenges in the Chinese property sector.  Treasury securities and agency MBS would continue to be purchased across sectors and coupons consistent with current practice.  The Federal Reserve s administered rates the interest on reserve balances rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate continued to support effective interest rate control and, outside of month and quarter end, the federal funds rate remained stable over the period.  Market participants estimates of the new date when the Treasury would exhaust its extraordinary measures and cash balance were wide ranging but some estimates suggested the date might be as early as mid December.  There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Growth in total nonfarm payroll employment slowed further in September, held down by a decline in state and local government employment.  The labor force participation rate edged lower in September, and the employment to population ratio moved up.  The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; this gain was noticeably larger than the index s year earlier 12 month change and was the fastest 12 month change since 2001.  The third quarter slowdown appeared to reflect a combination of factors, including the waning effect of previous fiscal stimulus measures, the surge in COVID 19 cases over the summer, and a plunge in motor vehicle purchases as extremely low dealer inventories constrained sales.  Residential investment dropped further in the third quarter; al though demand for housing was strong, shortages of construction supplies as well as tight land and labor markets restrained residential construction activity.  Growth in business fixed investment slowed sharply in the third quarter, as supply bottlenecks particularly for motor vehicles weighed on business equipment spending and a limited availability of construction materials held back spending on nonresidential structures.  Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry continued to weigh on exports and imports of automotive products, and shipping congestion continued to restrain trade overall.  Twelve month rates of inflation abroad continued to rise, reflecting further increases in energy prices, persistent pressures from supply bottlenecks, and past exchange rate depreciation in some EMEs.  Short term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased further, to its highest level since the facility was put in place.  Market based financing conditions were accommodative, and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories.  In domestic credit markets, financing conditions faced by nonfinancial firms in capital markets remained highly accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Trailing default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans decreased from already low levels, while market indicators of future expected default rates remained benign.  Delinquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools continued to fall but remained elevated for CMBS backed by hotel and retail properties.  In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.  Financing conditions for consumer credit remained accommodative for most borrowers, especially those with stronger credit scores.  While demand for credit cards strengthened, auto loan growth slowed in response to low dealer inventories and a weakening of auto sales.  In the financial sector, the staff noted that banks were strongly capitalized, with high levels of stable funding and high quality liquid assets.  The mean level of gross hedge fund leverage was noteworthy and its distribution was skewed, with particularly high leverage among funds in the top decile.  With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be close to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.  As a result, the 12 month change in PCE prices was projected to move up further relative to September s pace and to end the year well above 2 percent.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  The spread of the Delta variant had contributed to the slowdown in growth in the third quarter by damping household and business spending, holding down labor supply, and intensifying supply chain disruptions.  Participants noted that the underlying conditions supporting growth in demand remained strong and that, as the number of COVID 19 cases remained well below the summer s levels, growth in economic activity would likely show a pickup in the fourth quarter.  They noted that businesses had generally recorded robust sales despite labor shortages and other supply disruptions that had prevented them from fully meeting higher demand for their products.  Participants interpreted available data as suggesting that the spread of the Delta variant had slowed the shift of consumer demand toward purchases of services and away from spending on goods, stretching out the full reopening of the economy and intensifying supply and demand imbalances.  Participants observed that households had strong balance sheets and that consumer spending would also be supported by accommodative financial conditions.  Participants remarked that supply chain challenges and limited labor availability continued to be major constraints on manufacturing activity and the business sector more broadly.  Participants judged that supply constraints would likely continue for longer than they had previously expected.  Participants noted that data received over the intermeeting period indicated that labor market conditions had continued to improve.  Al though the September increase in payrolls had been moderate compared with recent months, the unemployment rate had declined further and previous months job growth had been revised up.  With COVID 19 cases expected to remain below the summer s levels, participants anticipated better payroll numbers in the months ahead.  Participants indicated that District contacts continued to report difficulties in finding and retaining workers and that, in addition to offering higher wages, businesses were turning to increased use of automation.  Several other participants suggested that labor supply was currently being depressed by pandemic related factors such as disruptions related to caregiving arrangements and noted that the importance of such factors would likely diminish as economic and public health conditions improved further.  Participants generally saw the current elevated level of inflation as largely reflecting factors that were likely to be transitory but judged that inflation pressures could take longer to subside than they had previously assessed.  Several participants commented on the financial stability risks including those relating to maturity and liquidity transformation associated with stablecoins and on the need for regulators to address these risks.  In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants agreed that the economy had made substantial further progress toward the Committee s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance regarding asset purchases.  Consequently, participants assessed that the criterion of substantial further progress had been met with regard to the Committee s maximum employment goal.  Some participants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would result in an earlier conclusion to net purchases.  They highlighted the more stringent criteria for raising the target range, compared with the criteria that applied to beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases.  Participants stressed that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk management considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment.  They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the summer s rise in COVID 19 cases had slowed their recovery.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members agreed that, in light of the substantial further progress the economy had made toward the Committee s goals since last December, the Committee should begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting.  Consequently, the Committee agreed that, beginning with the purchase schedule published in mid November, it would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month rather than $80 billion per month and would increase its holdings of agency MBS by at least $35 billion per month, rather than $40 billion per month.  Members also noted that the Committee was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook and agreed that the postmeeting statement should say so.  Members agreed that the statement should continue to note that the Committee s ongoing asset purchases helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions.  Effective November 4, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $70 billion and of agency MBS by $35 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid November.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $60 billion and of agency MBS by $30 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid December.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  The Federal Reserve s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.","id":17},{"text":" Market participants were attentive over the period to negotiations on the debt limit.  In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12 month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent in July.  Spreads of agency CMBS were generally at or below pre pandemic levels.  The share of mortgages in forbearance declined further in July and August.  Conditions for nonprime consumers in the credit card market eased from tight levels.  A Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.  Participants also discussed the developments in oil, gasoline, and agricultural sectors.  These participants noted that prices in some of those categories showed signs of stabilizing or even turned down of late.  Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.","id":18},{"text":" By contrast, the Wage Growth Tracker measure constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had not shown a similar pickup.

The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent over the 6 months ending in June, 1 percentage point faster than the 12 month change posted in December 2020.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), where high vaccination rates had increased resilience to COVID 19 outbreaks, incoming data were consistent with economic growth in the third quarter at a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter.  Conversely, in emerging market economies (EMEs) especially in Southeast Asia, where vaccination rates were lower a global resurgence in COVID 19 infections due to the Delta variant led to renewals of public health restrictions.  Yields on Treasury securities of intermediate maturities increased modestly, the market implied path of the federal funds rate steepened, domestic equity prices were unchanged, and speculative grade corporate bond spreads narrowed modestly.  In the second half of 2021, supply constraints were expected to resolve more slowly than previously assumed; in addition, the recent rise in COVID 19 cases was viewed as likely to exert a larger amount of restraint on consumer spending, hiring, and labor supply than previously anticipated.  In addition, some participants mentioned the risks associated with high asset valuations in the United States and abroad, and a number of participants commented on the importance of resolving the issues involving the federal government budget and debt ceiling in a timely manner.  Participants resumed their discussions on the progress made toward the Committee s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance regarding asset purchases and indicated that purchases would continue at their current pace until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee s goals of maximum employment and price stability.  The illustrative tapering path was designed to be simple to communicate and entailed a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases that, if begun later this year, would lead the Federal Reserve to end purchases around the middle of next year.  Participants generally commented that the illustrative path provided a straightforward and appropriate template that policymakers might follow, and a couple of participants observed that giving advance notice to the general public of a plan along these lines may reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction to a moderation in asset purchases.  No decision to proceed with a moderation of asset purchases was made at the meeting, but participants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate.  Participants reaffirmed that the Committee s substantial further progress standard regarding its asset purchases was distinct from the criteria given in its forward guidance on the federal funds rate and that a policy shift toward a moderation of asset purchases provided no direct signal about its interest rate policy.  Members further decided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that if progress toward the maximum employment and price stability goals continued broadly as expected, the Committee judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.  The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","id":18},{"text":" Participation in ON RRP operations increased from an average of $808 billion over the previous intermeeting period to $1.08 trillion.  In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.  The 12 month change in total and core PCE prices was well above 2 percent in July, and available data suggested that PCE price inflation had remained high in August.  Several participants expressed concern that the high degree of accommodation being provided by monetary policy, including through continued asset purchases, could increase risks to financial stability.  Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.

Nonetheless, participants expected the accumulated stock of savings, the release of pent up demand, and progress on vaccinations to continue to support household spending in coming months.  The labor shortages were causing firms to reduce hours and scale back production while also leading employers to provide incentives to attract and retain workers, including wage increases and signing and retention bonuses.  Some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer term inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures.  Many participants noted that although the economic recovery had slowed recently and the August increase in payrolls had fallen short of expectations, the labor market had continued to show improvement since the Committee s previous meeting.

In their discussion of considerations related to asset purchases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve s response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recovery.  Looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year because they saw the Committee s substantial further progress criterion as satisfied with respect to the price stability goal and as close to being satisfied with respect to the maximum employment goal.

Discussion of Asset Purchases Participants discussed aspects of the Federal Reserve s asset purchases, including progress made toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals since the adoption of the asset purchase guidance in December 2020.  Weekly estimates of private sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through the first part of July suggested that the pace of private employment gains had remained strong.  Citing reports received from contacts in a broad range of industries, participants indicated that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges remained widespread and continued to limit the ability of firms to keep up with strong demand.  Some participants noted that there were upside risks to inflation associated with concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer than currently anticipated and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.  With regard to the labor market, participants noted that the demand for workers had been strong in recent months, while the level of employment had been constrained by labor supply shortages and hiring difficulties.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.","id":19},{"text":" Recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of strong labor demand and increased difficulties in hiring that had more than offset the downward pressure on average earnings from disproportionately large employment gains in lower wage industries.  Although production in the chemicals industry had rebounded from the weather related disruptions earlier in the year, the supply chain issues faced by a number of other industries, particularly the motor vehicle industry, continued to weigh on overall factory output.  Many participants pointed out that the largest contributors to recent increases in measures of inflation were a handful of sectors most affected by temporary supply bottlenecks or sectors in which price levels were rebounding from depressed levels as the economy continued to reopen.  A number of participants judged that the effects of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages would likely complicate the task of interpreting the incoming data and assessing the speed at which these supply side factors would dissipate.  Most participants anticipated that the economy would continue to make progress toward those goals and, provided that the economy evolved broadly as they anticipated, they judged that the standard set out in the Committee s guidance regarding asset purchases could be reached this year.","id":19},{"text":" The Committee voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the SRF.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose further in June.  Growth in manufacturing output had picked up modestly in the second quarter.  Short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period.  Several foreign central banks scaled back their asset purchase programs.  Corporate bond and leveraged loan defaults also remained low.  Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate.","id":19},{"text":" The draft terms envisioned that the rate for the FIMA repo facility would be set equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, a rate equal to the minimum bid rate in the draft terms for the domestic SRF.  Several participants noted the importance of setting the minimum bid rate high enough so that the facility was positioned as a backstop, while some pointed out the importance of not setting the rate so high that usage of the facility could be stigmatized or that the facility would not sufficiently contain pressures that could spill over into the federal funds market.  The median respondent to the Desk s surveys of primary dealers and market participants continued to expect the pace of Federal Reserve asset purchases to begin to decline in the first quarter of 2022, although most respondents also saw a reasonable chance that this decline could occur one quarter earlier or later.  Combined with reduced social distancing and more widespread vaccinations, key factors that influence consumer spending including increasing job gains, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of household net worth, and low interest rates pointed to strong real PCE growth over the rest of the year.  However, nominal nonresidential construction spending declined further in April, and investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain weak in the current quarter, likely reflecting continued hesitation by businesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns.  With the strong economic recovery leading to an improved outlook for state and local tax revenues, and the additional federal support for these governments included in the American Rescue Plan, state and local purchases appeared likely to increase notably over the rest of the year.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Overall financial conditions eased during the intermeeting period as market participants appeared to remain confident that the economic recovery was broadly on track, that inflation over the medium term would stay contained, and that monetary policy would remain accommodative.  A straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the expected path for the federal funds rate moved lower over the intermeeting period and that the expected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the first quarter of 2023.  Many participants commented that accommodative financial conditions, the release of pent up demand, progress on widespread vaccination, the ongoing reduction of social distancing measures, and fiscal stimulus were important factors supporting spending.  Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee s reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.  In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.","id":20},{"text":" Moreover, business investment in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increasing further, as crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of drilling investment continued to rise through early June, with oil prices moving higher.  With respect to the business sector, most participants noted that activity in the service industries most adversely affected by the pandemic, such as in the leisure and hospitality sector, was rebounding as the economy reopened.  With inflation having run persistently below this longer run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","id":20},{"text":" Members judged that the economic outlook had continued to improve and that the most negative effects of the pandemic on the economy most likely had occurred.","id":20},{"text":" In addition, a surge in demand as the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent monthly price increases.  In addition, the surge in demand as the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent monthly price increases.","id":20},{"text":" The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak but had shown improvement.  Participants generally agreed that the economic recovery was incomplete and that risks to the economic outlook remained.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement.","id":20},{"text":" Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period.  The manager provided an update on progress toward winding down a number of emergency facilities established under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  The incoming data for this sector indicated that residential investment spending was being temporarily held back in the second quarter by materials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale.  Available indicators suggested that equipment and intangibles investment particularly in high tech categories was increasing solidly in the second quarter.  While small business loan originations rose in April, surpassing pre pandemic levels, loans made under the PPP likely accounted for a significant portion of that growth.  In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of COVID 19 in the United States.","id":20},{"text":" Nominal state and local construction spending, however, edged down in April.","id":20},{"text":" While market participants took note of the Federal Reserve Board s announcement on winding down the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) holdings, it elicited little price response.

Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.","id":20},{"text":" The proposed design for a standing FIMA repo facility was similar in structure to the existing temporary FIMA repo facility.  Such an adjustment would be expected to raise the federal funds rate and to lift other overnight rates modestly.  State and local government purchases looked to be increasing significantly, as the payrolls of these governments expanded solidly over April and May.  The Committee s standard of substantial further progress was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected progress to continue.","id":20},{"text":" Lower term premiums appeared to be a significant component of the declines, as reflected by lower implied volatility on longer term interest rates.  Amid heightened demand and reduced supply for short term investments, the ON RRP continued to maintain a floor on overnight rates.  Consumer price inflation through April as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the PCE price index had picked up notably, largely reflecting transitory factors.  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over April and May, though at a slower monthly pace than over February and March.  A staff measure of the 12 month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had stepped up significantly in April relative to March.  Broad stock price indexes increased slightly over the intermeeting period, with stocks in cyclically sensitive sectors generally outperforming.  Over the next year, the transitory price increases caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were expected to largely reverse, and the growth in demand was forecast to ease.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that indicators of consumer spending had continued to surge and expected that further gains in spending would contribute significantly to the economic recovery.  Some participants commented that recent readings of inflation measures that exclude volatile components, such as trimmed mean measures, had been relatively stable at or just below 2 percent.  The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the United States economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.","id":20},{"text":" Against this backdrop, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) printed at 1 basis point each day in the intermeeting period, while the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) decreased 1 basis point, to 6 basis points.  Participants noted that their District contacts had reported having trouble hiring workers to meet demand, likely reflecting factors such as early retirements, concerns about the virus, childcare responsibilities, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.  Citing recent wage data and reports from business contacts, many participants judged that labor shortages were putting upward pressure on wages or leading employers to provide additional financial incentives to attract and retain workers, particularly in lower wage occupations.","id":20},{"text":" There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Price increases were concentrated in relatively few items, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remained subdued amid considerable economic slack.  International financial market participants were focused on news about inflation and monetary policy communications.  Delinquency rates on bank C I loans also remained low in the first quarter.  Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.","id":20},{"text":" In this regard, a number of participants noted the potential for pressures in short term funding markets to arise from time to time, even with monetary policy operating in an ample reserves regime.  Participants also noted that the expected surge in demand as the economy reopens further, along with some transitory supply chain bottlenecks, would contribute to PCE price inflation temporarily running somewhat above 2 percent.  Despite the expected short run fluctuations in measured inflation, many participants commented that various measures of longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the Committee s longer run goals.  They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.","id":21},{"text":" As of March, payroll employment had retraced almost two thirds of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic.  Consumer loans grew at a robust pace in February, reflecting the continued expansion of auto loans and a partial rebound in credit card account balances.  Banks also reported that standards on credit cards eased over the first quarter of 2021 but were generally still tighter than before the pandemic.  Regarding financial leverage, the staff noted that bank capital ratios remained above pre pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, but risks remained.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  Members also remarked that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations.","id":21},{"text":" The effective federal funds rate was steady at 7 basis points.  Manufacturing output rebounded strongly in March following weather related disruptions to production in February.  Market indicators of future default expectations were little changed and stayed low.  However, even amid improving financing conditions, many small businesses remained under financial stress.  Leverage among hedge funds was elevated and increased in the third quarter of last year for the most highly leveraged funds.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.","id":21},{"text":" Regarding considerations concerning a permanent standing repo facility, the briefing noted that standing repo operations could be viewed as useful in forestalling funding strains that could spill over into other overnight markets and limit dealers intermediation activity in financial markets.  However, a standing repo facility could be seen as a form of liquidity support for nonbank financial institutions, and one that could create incentives for firms with access to the facility to take on more liquidity risk against eligible securities than would otherwise be the case.  In their discussion of considerations related to the establishment of a standing repo facility as part of the Committee s overall approach to policy implementations in an ample reserves regime, a substantial majority of participants saw the potential benefits of an appropriately calibrated facility as outweighing the potential costs.  Nearly all participants commented that a standing repo facility, by acting as a backstop, could help address pressures in the markets for United States Treasury securities and Treasury repo that could spill over to other funding markets and impair the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.  A couple of participants remarked that most of the benefits of a standing repo facility could be realized by the Federal Reserve maintaining readiness to conduct repo operations on short notice as needed, noting that such an arrangement could avoid some of the costs of a standing facility.  The March rise in factory output occurred despite lingering supply constraints; for example, weather damaged facilities in Texas used to produce petrochemical and plastic materials had not yet been fully repaired, and semiconductor shortages were still weighing on motor vehicle production.  A straight read of overnight index swap quotes suggested that the expected path for the federal funds rate was little changed over the intermeeting period and that the expected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the first quarter of 2023.  The 12 month changes in total and core PCE prices were expected to move above 2 percent in coming months as the unusually low readings from the spring of 2020 dropped out of the calculation window and as a recent jump in consumer energy prices pushed up the total measure.  Many participants commented that fiscal stimulus, accommodative financial conditions, the release of pent up demand, progress on widespread vaccination, and the ongoing reduction of social distancing measures were important factors supporting spending.  Some participants mentioned the potential risks to the financial system stemming from the activities of hedge funds and other leveraged investors, commenting on the limited visibility into the activities of these entities or on the prudential risk management practices of dealers prime brokerage businesses.  In their discussion of the Federal Reserve s asset purchases, various participants noted that it would likely be some time until the economy had made substantial further progress toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals relative to the conditions prevailing in December 2020 when the Committee first provided its guidance for asset purchases.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.","id":21},{"text":" The manager concluded with an update on three operational issues.  Credit remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores.  Some remarked that the capital positions and loan loss reserves at large banks remained high, and earnings were strong.  Participants agreed that the economy was still far from the Committee s longer run goals.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.","id":21},{"text":" However, amid ongoing strong demand for safe short term investments and reduced Treasury bill supply, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) stood at 1 basis point throughout the period.  In the first quarter of 2021, the staff s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had returned to the level that prevailed in 2018.  Nevertheless, the slowdown appeared less severe than observed declines in mobility would have suggested, underscoring that foreign economies continued to adapt to public health restrictions.  Broad stock price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, with outperformance by technology stocks and stocks sensitive to consumer discretionary spending.  Nevertheless, a couple of participants highlighted that forbearance programs instituted in response to the pandemic could be masking vulnerabilities among households and businesses.  Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.","id":21},{"text":" A few participants noted that, had a FIMA repo facility been in place in March 2020, it likely would have significantly damped pressures in these markets caused by the abrupt need for dollar funding abroad.  Factors that had stressed foreign financial markets earlier this year rising United States interest rates, resurging COVID 19 cases, and renewed lockdowns in a number of countries appeared less concerning to global investors over the intermeeting period.  Participants Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that the COVID 19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.","id":21},{"text":"Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Consumer price inflation through February as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) continued to run well below 2 percent.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but tight for those with subprime scores.","id":21},{"text":" Financial conditions eased modestly as market participants continued to focus on progress toward economic reopening as well as supportive monetary and fiscal policy.  The briefing also reviewed considerations that could be relevant for policymakers judgments regarding whether these arrangements should become permanent standing facilities.  The staff noted that corporate bond spreads had declined notably since late last year and were at the lower ends of their historical distributions.  Participants who commented on financial stability agreed that the financial sector had shown resilience during the pandemic, in large part reflecting strong policy support.  The timing of such communications would depend on the evolution of the economy and the pace of progress toward the Committee s goals.","id":21},{"text":" Both imports and exports fell from their January levels, the first nominal decline in each since last May.  Assets under management increased somewhat for government money market funds (MMFs) but declined slightly for prime MMFs.  Some participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors.","id":21},{"text":" The deputy manager discussed the evolution of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet and related developments in money markets.  Sales of both new and existing homes increased further in January, and home prices continued to rise briskly.  Participants also observed that residential construction continued to be solid and home sales remained robust in part because of low interest rates.","id":22},{"text":" Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investors appeared to have become more optimistic about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period against the backdrop of progress on COVID 19 vaccinations, signs of stronger domestic spending, and additional fiscal stimulus.  Improved United States economic growth prospects and optimism about the eventual lifting of social distancing and related restrictions globally were major drivers of asset prices abroad, spurring sizable increases in sovereign yields in advanced foreign economies.  Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  Members also determined that, with oil prices having essentially retraced their pandemic related declines, it was appropriate to remove the reference to oil prices as a factor holding down consumer price inflation and to simply state that inflation continues to run below 2 percent.","id":22},{"text":" Market contacts suggested that continued rapid expansion of reserves could put further downward pressure on money market rates.  No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Consumer spending appeared to be increasing in the first quarter at a pace considerably faster, on balance, than in the fourth quarter of last year.  Services imports and exports remained depressed, weighed down by the continued suspension of most international travel.  Corporate bond defaults declined in December and January and reached levels substantially below their 2019 average.  Auto loan balances continued to grow in January, while credit card balances declined.  Interest rates on new credit card offers to borrowers with prime credit scores continued to trend down, on net, through December.  Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.","id":22},{"text":" In addition, the personal saving rate jumped to an even higher level in January, and ongoing gains in labor earnings along with further fiscal support pointed to additional increases in accumulated household savings.  The longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.","id":22},{"text":" As of February, payroll employment had retraced somewhat more than half of the losses seen since the onset of the pandemic.  In February, the 12 month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.7 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.3 percent over the same period.  Several participants suggested that the ARP could hasten the recovery, which could help limit longer term damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic.","id":22},{"text":" Contacts noted that these expectations have been held steady by policymaker communications emphasizing both the need to see realized progress toward the Committee s goals and the intent to communicate well in advance of the time when progress could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.  The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 7 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, decreasing somewhat relative to the previous intermeeting period average amid a net decrease in Treasury bill issuance and rising reserves.  All told, real GDP growth was projected to be substantial this year and the unemployment rate was forecast to decline markedly, as the staff s projection also continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for further easing in social distancing this year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee s maximum employment and price stability goals.","id":22},{"text":" A few participants suggested that some type of dynamic or differential limit could be considered in the future to enable the ON RRP facility to adapt more readily to market developments.  Even though the labor force participation rate edged down, the employment to population ratio moved up somewhat over January and February; both measures remained below their pre pandemic levels.  Manufacturing activity continued to generally outperform activity in the services sector, and manufactured exports from China and some other Asian economies remained strong, especially to the United States.  Many participants also pointed to the elevated level of household savings and judged that the release of pent up demand could boost consumption growth further as social distancing waned.","id":22},{"text":" Following the discussion, the Chair noted the potential for downward pressure on money market rates and suggested that, should undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerge, it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates at upcoming meetings or even between meetings to support effective policy implementation and ensure that the federal funds rate remains well within the target range.  Participants also noted the importance of communicating to the public that the existing guidance, together with the new monetary policy framework as delineated in the revised Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, meant that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee s maximum employment and inflation goals.","id":22},{"text":" In their discussion following the Desk briefings, participants noted that the ON RRP facility had been very effective in establishing a firm floor for the federal funds rate and supporting monetary policy implementation.  In response to rising yields, the Reserve Bank of Australia increased its bond purchases, and the European Central Bank indicated it would increase the pace of its bond purchases going forward.  Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently, al though the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak.  Market based measures of inflation compensation at the 5 and 10 year horizons had continued to move up over the intermeeting period, while survey based measures of inflation expectations were little changed on balance.  Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak.","id":22},{"text":" Responses to the Desk surveys indicated that many market participants anticipated adjustments to the interest on excess reserves rate and the ON RRP rate at or before the June meeting.  Consumer price inflation through January as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained well below 2 percent.  Starts of single family homes moved down notably over January and February, in part likely reflecting severe winter weather in February.  Credit was broadly available to higher score borrowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria but tightened further for borrowers with lower credit scores.  Participants noted that overall financial conditions remained highly accommodative, in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy.  In particular, various participants noted that changes in the path of policy should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than forecasts.  The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook.","id":22},{"text":" Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.

Such clarity facilitates well informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average.  Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past.  The Committee judges that longer term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and moderate long term interest rates and enhance the Committee s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.  The evolving outlooks for the path of the virus and for fiscal policy were the main drivers of financial markets over the intermeeting period.  The emergence of a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate bolstered investor expectations for additional fiscal stimulus, prompting upward revisions to forecasts for economic growth this year.  Credit spreads narrowed further, especially for riskier borrowers.  Expectations for the path of the target federal funds rate over the next several years, as implied by interest rate futures and by the Desk Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, were relatively little changed from December.  The Desk survey results indicated that a majority of market participants anticipated that the pace of net asset purchases would remain stable for the remainder of the year and slow around the first quarter of 2022.  Going forward, reserves were projected to rise rapidly through the summer, reflecting ongoing Federal Reserve asset purchases as well as expected declines in balances held in the Treasury General Account.  First, given the sustained stability in term repurchase markets, the Desk proposed discontinuing the weekly one month term repurchase operations, beginning in mid February.  No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System s account during the intermeeting period.  Total nonfarm payroll employment fell in December, with especially sharp declines in the leisure and hospitality sector.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in December, a gain that was noticeably higher than the measure s year earlier 12 month change.  Available indicators pointed to a strong increase in investment in equipment and intangibles in the fourth quarter of 2020, as this component of capital spending recovered from its sharp decline over the first half of the year.  Total real government purchases appeared to have fallen further in the fourth quarter, though at a slower pace than in the third quarter.  Taken together, these data suggested that net exports made a significant negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment improved and risk asset prices moved higher over the intermeeting period on greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus.  OIS quotes suggested that the expected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the third quarter of 2023, little changed from the time of the December meeting.  Most of the steepening of the Treasury yield curve occurred following the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections, which reportedly bolstered market participants expectations for additional fiscal stimulus.  Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities increased moderately, on net, continuing the upward trend observed over recent months, with the increase over the intermeeting period reportedly reflecting greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus and an associated improvement in the longer run economic outlook.  Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat.  Spreads on municipal bond yields narrowed notably in January, reportedly reflecting increased expectations of additional fiscal stimulus and aid to state and local governments.  Conditions in short term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, including over the year end.  Commercial paper outstanding declined somewhat in late December but quickly rebounded in early January to the levels observed before year end.  Amid stable market conditions, there was no take up at the Commercial Paper Funding Facility or the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility over the intermeeting period.  Assets under management (AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) remained stable over the intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate were little changed, averaging 9 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period.  Longer term sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies rose slightly on improved investor sentiment even while several major central banks reaffirmed their commitment to continue or possibly expand accommodative policies.  Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance was also strong in December, as issuance volumes excluding refinancing topped their averages for previous months of 2020 and were above those observed during the same period of 2019.  C I loans declined in the fourth quarter because of weak origination activity, loan forgiveness at the Paycheck Protection Program, and continued repayments of bank debt.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained stable in recent months after deteriorating substantially for several months following the onset of the pandemic.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to slightly outpace upgrades in November and December, and the monthly volume of nonfinancial corporate bond defaults remained relatively low.  Meanwhile, liquidity needs of small businesses remained high as businesses continued to operate at reduced capacity.  Financing conditions in the municipal bond market remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period, and the credit quality of municipal debt remained roughly stable.  For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through capital markets, financing conditions remained generally accommodative, easing further over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on agency CMBS ticked down, on net, and issuance remained elevated through December, al though below its recent historical high in October.  Risk spreads on triple B non agency CMBS declined, and spreads on triple A non agency CMBS stayed close to their historical lows.  Mortgage rates ticked up slightly but stayed near historically low levels, supporting strong loan origination activity.  The January SLOOS suggested that for most types of residential mortgages, banks lending standards remained unchanged, while loan demand was either little changed or somewhat stronger.  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but tight for those with subprime scores.  However, the volume of new cards and available credit continued to rise for both prime and nonprime borrowers.  Interest rates on new credit card offers for nonprime borrowers stayed elevated, and financing conditions remained tight for those borrowers.  Auto loan balances continued to increase solidly for prime and near prime borrowers but declined further for subprime borrowers.  Prices for industrial and multifamily properties continued to grow through 2020 at about the same pace as in the past several years, while prices of office buildings and retail establishments started to fall.  The staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with household and business borrowing as notable, reflecting increased leverage and decreased incomes and revenues in 2020.  The staff judged that vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage were moderate, noting that capital ratios at the largest bank holding companies rose over the course of last year; leverage among hedge funds was elevated but it did decline last spring for the most highly leveraged funds.  Banks continued to maintain significant levels of high quality liquid assets and stable sources of funding.  In contrast, money market funds and open ended mutual funds were characterized by significant vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation.  Taken together, these stimulus measures were expected to partly offset the substantial drag on aggregate demand that would result from the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus enacted in the spring of 2020.  The staff s projection continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for an easing in social distancing in 2021.  With the boost to growth from the reduction in social distancing assumed to be largely completed by the end of 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down over the remainder of the medium term.  With monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023.  The staff viewed the possibility that a larger than anticipated fiscal package would be enacted in coming months as a modest upside risk to the baseline economic outlook.  The pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing.  Participants observed that the resurgence in COVID 19 infections and associated social distancing measures were restraining activity in some sectors, particularly in industries such as travel and leisure and hospitality.  They saw progress on vaccinations as essential for supporting further gains in aggregate consumer spending and for the economic recovery more generally.  In commenting on recent data for household spending, most participants discussed the composition of expenditures, with strong spending on many goods, especially durables, and weakness in spending on some services, especially in travel and in leisure and hospitality.  The relative strength in consumer spending on goods was supported by fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits as well as by accommodative monetary policy.  The weakness in services spending was largely attributed to the pandemic and associated social distancing measures, which limited spending on services that depend heavily on in person contact.  Participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust; low interest rates were viewed as an important factor supporting the strength in housing activity.  Many participants stressed that sustained support from fiscal policy would help address the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy could also help by promoting the economy s return to maximum employment and price stability.  In their remarks on the business sector, participants commented that business equipment investment had continued to show strength while nonresidential construction remained weak.  Payroll employment fell in December, as continued job gains in many industries were outweighed by significant layoffs in industries where the resurgence of the virus had weighed heavily on activity.  Some participants pointed to the continued increase in market based measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels recorded in the spring as consistent with the view that inflation was likely to move up gradually over time; others noted that survey based measures were little changed, on net, over the year as a whole.  However, a few participants remarked that credit conditions were relatively tight for borrowers with low credit scores and for some small and medium sized businesses that rely on bank lending rather than capital markets to meet their financing needs.  In addition, results from the most recent stress tests indicated that the largest banks could withstand very stressed economic conditions.  Regarding asset valuations, some participants commented that equity valuations had risen further, that initial public offering activity was elevated, or that valuations might have been affected by retail investors trading through electronic platforms.  In contrast, participants remarked that the prospect of an effective vaccine program, the recently enacted fiscal support, and the potential for additional fiscal actions had led them to judge that the medium term outlook had improved.  Participants noted that economic conditions were currently far from the Committee s longer run goals and that the stance for policy would need to remain accommodative until those goals were achieved.  Consequently, all participants supported maintaining the Committee s current settings and outcome based guidance for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases.  Participants noted that the increase in the Federal Reserve s balance sheet since last March had materially eased financial conditions and was providing substantial support to the economy.  With the economy still far from those goals, participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.  Various participants noted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longer run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases.  Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Effective January 28, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short term United States dollar funding markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to United States households and businesses.  These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.","id":23}]
